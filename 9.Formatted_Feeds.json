While crypto did not stand out as a core topic amongst the roles, this group will be responsible for ensuring digital asset rules are implemented.</p><p>The European Union (EU), a bloc of 27 nations, was the first major jurisdiction in the world to establish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/31/eu-formally-signs-new-crypto-licensing-money-laundering-rules-into-law/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bespoke crypto legislative package last year, otherwise known as the Markets in Crypto Assets&lt;/a&gt; legislation (MiCA). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/27/eus-restrictive-stablecoin-rules-take-effect-soon-and-issuers-are-running-out-of-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stablecoin rules came into force in June, while the rest of the rules are expected to come in force by December&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t expect a big legislative agenda in the blockchain space and in the digital space per se, over the next year or so,&quot; said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation.</p><p>Though no commissioner role is solely dedicated to crypto, the EU still has to ensure MiCA is being followed. Some commissioners will have digital assets fall within their remit as the nation advances its crypto rules, Foster said.</p><p>&quot;What the industry is really wanting is the EU to continue to discuss with its international partners and ensure that the rules that are being developed across the globe are to the extent possible, interoperable, consistent, and have the same goals,&quot; Foster said.</p><p>The commissioners have also been tasked with exploring whether or not more regulation is needed.</p><p>&quot;According, to MiCA, we are also required to present a report on the latest developments with respect to crypto assets, including an assessment of the necessity and feasibility of regulating decentralized finance activities, lending and borrowing of crypto assets, as well as non-fungible tokens,&quot; said Marcel Haag, director of Horizontal Policies at the European Commission, at a Crypto Council for Innovation Forum last week.</p><p>They will also have to decide whether or not to terminate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/dlt-pilot-regime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Distributed Ledger Technology&lt;/a&gt; pilot or make it permanent and review a proposal for establishing a legal framework for the digital euro, a central bank digital currency issued by the European Central Bank.</p><p>The commission is also set to launch a legal analysis on the suitability of member states&apos; legislation for financial asset tokenization, Haag said.</p><p>Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/learn/mica-eus-comprehensive-new-crypto-regulation-explained/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MiCA, EU\u2019s Comprehensive New Crypto Regulation, Explained&lt;/a&gt;</p><h2>The Commission</h2><p>The EU commission is the executive branch of the EU. Each member state has to select one person to form the commission.</p><p>Von der Leyen, who asked for a balanced gender group of commissioners, had the task of choosing what roles each person will take on for the next five years. People were appointed for roles on trade, climate, technology, economy, international partnership, finance and more.</p><p>Each commissioner will have their own focus, but Von der Leyen said in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/towards-new-commission-2024-2029/commissioners-designate-2024-2029_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mission letters&lt;/a&gt; the priorities are not standalone and will affect each other.</p><p>Plus, crypto is a trans-sectoral topic, Faustine Fleuret, president of industry group ADAN that focuses on Web3 said, adding that they could &quot;engage with everyone&quot; in the commission when it comes to the sector.</p><p>Commissioners from Portugal, Finland and France will likely have some purview over crypto.</p><h2>St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9</h2><p>France&apos;s St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 has been chosen to be the executive vice-president for prosperity and industrial strategy, as well as the commissioner for industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the single market.</p><p>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/document/6ef52679-19b9-4a8d-b7b2-cb99eb384eca_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;job would include improving access to finance&lt;/a&gt;, simplifying the regulatory environment and promoting innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises. He will also oversee a project called the &quot;horizontal single market strategy&quot; that will require him to address barriers to the movement of goods and services abroad. His role could bring crypto under his oversight, Fleuret said.</p><p>Fleuret said she could see the industry pushing Web3 interests and positions on &quot;trade and economic safety, finance, the capital market union, innovation and research&quot; to S\u00e9journ\u00e9.</p><p>&quot;We had previous relations with St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 during the MiCA negotiation, and at that stage, he was quite open to innovation,&quot; Fleuret said, adding that he believed in regulating the sector but knew not to hamper crypto with rules that were too strict.</p><h2>Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque</h2><p>Portugal&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/document/ac06a896-2645-4857-9958-467d2ce6f221_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt; will be the commissioner for financial services and the savings and investment union. Her work will include ensuring rules for the financial sector are enforced and improving the EU&apos;s supervisory system. She will work on improving digital finance and payments.</p><p>Plus, Albuquerque will ensure the enforcement of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/26/eu-parliament-adopts-anti-money-laundering-rules-package-also-policing-crypto/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anti-money laundering package&lt;/a&gt; that targets large cash payments, crypto firms and more.</p><p>The EU has been considering doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/27/nft-private-wallet-fates-hang-on-eu-crypto-talks-this-week/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a MiCA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; to address issues like crypto staking, lending and decentralized finance.</p><p>&quot;If the commission were to come up with new legislation specifically for digital assets, it would most likely be the Portuguese Commissioner Albuquerque,&quot; Foster said.</p><p>She might have to coordinate and get input from one of the executive vice presidents, which would most likely be S\u00e9journ\u00e9, Foster added.</p><p>&quot;She has a background in financial services. She&apos;s a former finance minister... So she&apos;s very experienced in traditional finance,&quot; Foster said. Her crypto views were not available online.</p><h2>Henna Virkkunen</h2><p>Another figure the industry thinks is important to watch out for is &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/document/3b537594-9264-4249-a912-5b102b7b49a3_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Finland&apos;s Henna Virkkunen&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>&quot;We also think that one really important portfolio will be the one of Henna Virkkunen, who will be in charge of tech, sovereignty, security and democracy, because of all the related topics within Web3,&quot; Fleuret said.</p><p>Virkkunen&apos;s role will include boosting artificial intelligence innovation, looking at how digital technologies will enhance law enforcement capabilities, strengthening cybersecurity and taking enforcement action using the Digital Services Act where necessary to promote online safety. She &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-17/eu-picks-tech-enforcer-who-helped-write-its-social-media-rules?sref=3REHEaVI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;will also have to work with S\u00e9journ\u00e9&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/06/28/elections-across-europe-wont-hinder-blocs-crypto-ambitions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Elections Across Europe Won&apos;t Hinder Bloc&apos;s Crypto Ambitions&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

This law has drawn significant backlash from Ardoino, who claims the strict cash reserve requirements could present systemic risks to banks and digital assets.</p>\n<p>Ardoino emphasized the need for a framework that balances risk management with innovation and user protection. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tether&#8217;s decision to delist EURt has not been taken lightly, but until a more risk-averse regulatory framework in Europe is in place\u2014one that fosters innovation, offers the stability and protection our users deserve and avoids potential banking systemic risks\u2014we have chosen to prioritize other initiatives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Tether might not comply with MiCA, Ardoino pointed out that the firm&#8217;s new initiative, Hadron, will be a top priority in the European region. According to him, Hadron has the potential to revolutionize the accessibility of asset tokenization for institutions, governments, fund managers, and private companies.</p>\n<p>Dutch fintech firm Quantoz has already <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-invests-in-dutch-firm-to-launch-mica-compliant-stablecoins/\">leveraged Hadron to issue EURQ and USDQ stablecoins</a>.

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk to Solana ecosystem people, I\u2019ll sometimes ask what new projects they\u2019ve been hearing about. One such project that\u2019s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren\u2019t useful if they aren\u2019t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation\u2019s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren\u2019t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example \u2014 the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren\u2019t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins \u201cget there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform\u2019s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan\u2019s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem\u2019s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana\u2019s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

It can be thought of as the aggregate cost basis of all coins currently in circulation.\n</p><p>High profit-taking combined with the overvaluation signaled by the MVRV could lead to a market correction.\n</p><p>Several factors have helped catapult XRP prices recently, surging to a local high of $1.60 last week before paring gains to as low as $1.30.

He\u2019s revising that again, according to a Monday note \u2014 this time to $650.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes after MicroStrategy last week completed a $3 billion offering of convertible senior notes. It then revealed in a Monday filing that it bought <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-100k-microstrategy-buy\">55,500 BTC</a> from Nov. 18 to Nov. 24 for $5.4 billion in cash (averaging $97,862 each).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR shares hovered around $402 at 2 pm ET Monday \u2014 down 4.7% on the day but up 70% from a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strength of the MSTR rally has some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739669-microstrategy-paying-245000-per-bitcoin-makes-no-sense-mstr-stock\">questioning</a> the idea that these shares should trade at a nearly 3x premium to the market value of the company\u2019s BTC pile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But MicroStrategy, via treasury operations, has generated ~79,130 bitcoins YTD, translating into a 41.8% BTC yield (the % change of the ratio between MSTR\u2019s bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count), Palmer explained. That BTC is currently worth roughly $7.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe regard the dollar values of the bitcoins that MSTR creates, calculated by using its BTC yield, as analogous to earnings, and we believe they can be projected and contextualized through the attachment of a valuation multiple,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On to Coinbase, Oppenheimer analysts on Monday raised their COIN price target from $265 to $358. The stock was trading around $311 at 2 pm ET Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They mention that the \u201cchilling effect\u201d created by SEC lawsuits against \u201cwidely perceived good actors\u201d in the segment, like Coinbase, \u201ccan\u2019t be understated.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt had deterred new capital going into this space, and many developers had pivoted to other industries,\u201d they added. \u201cBut the industry has a chance to rebuild the reputation, and Coinbase is leading this new chapter.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the expectation of a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">yet-to-be-named</a> new SEC chair embracing crypto as a catalyst, Coinbase\u2019s trading volumes have increased substantially since the US election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Average daily volumes have risen to $6.5 billion since Election Day \u2014 higher than the $2.4 billion YTD average prior to Nov. 5. Oppenheimer is projecting Q4 spot trading volume to be $350 billion (would be up 89% quarter over quarter and 127% year over year) and for \u201chigh trading volume to sustain under <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">Trump\u2019s crypto policy</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for other crypto stocks, Compass Point analyst Joe Flynn increased Galaxy\u2019s price target from $22 (CAD) to $33 (~$24 CAD on Monday afternoon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond higher crypto prices and trading volumes momentum, GLXY is set to benefit from its expected uplisting to the Nasdaq and its term sheet with a hyperscaler to host high-performance computing (HPC) at its Helios campus \u2014 a datacenter Flynn called an \u201cunderappreciated asset.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flynn, also last week, lowered its rating of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital\u2019s stock to neutral. He noted that \u201cwhile MARA is an outsized beneficiary of higher BTC prices due to its HODL strategy, we don\u2019t see much additional upside from the base business itself.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s competing miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which notably <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/core-scientific-rejects-coreweave-buyout-bid-after-big-hpc-deal\">offers HPC hosting</a> to cloud provider CoreWeave. Flynn wrote earlier this month that CORZ is \u201cwell positioned to continue expanding their existing lead in delivering application specific HPC/GPU datacenters with a single tenant focus.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CORZ is the top holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) \u2014 the largest blockchain-focused equity ETF. Other stocks in the top five are COIN, MSTR, Hut 8 Mining and GLXY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Weiskopf, who co-manages BLOK\u2019s portfolio, said it\u2019s hard to value blockchain-fueled disruption over the next decade as regulations become more crypto-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told me: \u201cThe real excitement should be around the adoption of tokenization as the application and how blockchain as the technology will <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/investor-appetite-for-tokenized-funds\">soon transform</a> industries across the board.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",
