        "content": "<p>Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR).\n\nBitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been one of the stocks to watch in 2024. The company is up 416% year-to-date, up as much as 600% at one point last week. \n\nHowever, since the short report from <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/21/microstrategy-falls-16-despite-new-bitcoin-record-as-some-question-valuation\" target=\"_blank\">Citron Research</a> came out on Nov. 21, the stock has dropped almost 40%, subsequently burning retail in the process. This drop coincided with bitcoin dropping almost 10% to $90,000 from its all-time high of just shy of $100,000. \n\nAccording to a post on X by the <a href=\"https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1861518867324903778\" target=\"_blank\">Kobeissi Letter</a>, which is an industry-leading commentary on global markets, on Nov. 20 retail investors bought up to $42 million worth of MicroStrategy common stock. This was the largest daily retail buy on record and was eight times higher than the daily average in October. Last week alone, retail investors bought nearly $100 million worth of shares. </p><p>As a result of this 40% share price drop, the net asset value (NAV) premium on MicroStrategy has now dropped to around 2.09, one of the lowest premium levels since September. The NAV premium can be worked out by how much the company's market cap, which is trading at $75 billion against its <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/25/michael-saylors-micro-strategy-makes-mammoth-btc-purchase-adding-55-500-tokens-for-5-4-b\" target=\"_blank\">386,700 bitcoin</a> holdings which are worth $36 billion. This gives MicroStrategy a NAV premium of 2.09 against its bitcoin holdings. \n\nFurthermore, to put into perspective how much trading volume has been seen in MicroStrategy as of late. Last week, MicroStrategy saw $136 billion in volume. This was significantly higher than any period of the Gamestop (GME) mania, according to <a href=\"https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1860360735101980749\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Balchunas</a>, Senior Bloomberg analyst. \n\n\"Even the most intense week of GameStop Mania couldn't come close to the week MicroStrategy just had with $136 billion in volume. I also threw Amazon (AMZ) in there as well, it also has never had a week like this either,\" according to Balchunas. </p><p></p><p></p>",

On the other hand, the Japanese yen (JPY) is seen as a safe-haven currency that investors turn to during times of stress. Thus, a decline in AUD/JPY is considered a risk-off signal.</p><p>Matt Simpson, an analyst at The City Index, summed it up in his <a href=\"https://www.cityindex.com/en-au/news-and-analysis/2025-could-be-one-heck-of-a-ride-if-bearish-aud-jpy-clues-are-correct/\" target=\"_blank\">analysis</a> as follows: \"As AUD/JPY is a classic barometer of risk, we should take note that all is not looking well around current levels.

The Japanese yen began rising on rumors that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) was about to hike rates, which it did at the end of the month. The AUD/JPY pair dropped over 8% to 98 in July, hinting at a wave of risk aversion that kicked in during the first week of August.</p><p>BTC fell from roughly $70,000 to $50,000 as the yen strength led to traders closing bullish bets in risk assets funded by the cheap JPY-denominated loans. The AUD/JPY pair eventually found a floor at 90 and rebounded alongside other risk assets.</p><p>Fast forward to now, the AUD/JPY pair has dipped below the trendline, characterizing its recovery from the early August low of 90. The breakdown points to a renewed strength in the yen accompanied by a growing chatter of a possible BOJ rate hike next month.</p><p>If that's not enough, markets are second-guessing the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by another 25 basis points next month and trade war fears are resurfacing with President-elect Donald Trump's plans to impose the supposedly-inflationary tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.</p><p>\"Expectations are growing that the BOJ will raise rates again in December.

An uptick in open interest alongside a price is said to validate an uptrend, and ether's price has surged 35% to $3,400 this month, matching the industry leader's bitcoin's price gain.\n\nAccording to data source Velo, the gap between three-month ETH futures and spot prices, the so-called premium, has expanded to an annualized 16% on offshore exchanges Binance, OKX and Deribit.

The strategy comprises a long position in the spot ETF with a simultaneous short in the CME futures.\n\nActivity in the ether options market listed on Deribit is also picking up, with over 2 million contracts active or open at press time, the highest since late June. In notional terms, the open interest stands at $7.33 billion, according to Deribit Metrics.\n\nThe price uptick has further driven up the value of assets locked on Ethereum-based applications to $65 billion as of Wednesday, a figure last seen in May 2022.\n\nA major chunk of those, however, are held on three applications. Liquid staking protocol Lido holds over $32 billion in locked ether, Aave, a lending protocol, holds $26 billion in various assets, and restaking platform EigenLayer holds $14 billion.\n\nData shows a bump in revenue, fees, new wallets and on-chain volumes on Ethereum, with the past month showing elevated levels of activity compared to the period from May to September. (The metrics are no where close to an year-to-date peak seen in March, when interest around ETH ETFs was at a high.)\n\nThe Solana network and its applications continue to dominate DeFi activity, however, due to its broader retail appeal and cheap fees.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1948e70e049736ef95e33909f22318aac42494f-1031x641.png\" /><p><a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoin/tether\" target=\"_blank\">Stablecoin data</a> further shows that Ethereum has more USDT hosted than Tron, with $60.3 billion on Ethereum compared to $57.94 billion on Tron, for the first time since June 2022.\n\nAmong sentiment factors, president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory has brought back hopes of a decentralized finance (DeFi) bull market, at least among some investors, and with it demand for ETH.\n\nThe campaign indicated a move toward reducing the regulatory burden on crypto, potentially making it easier for DeFi platforms to operate within the U.S \u2014 a promise that has spurred <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/ether-surges-10-as-trump-victory-brings-back-defi-bullishness\" target=\"_blank\">growth in ETH</a> and major DeFi tokens since early November.</p>",

Just four days after the plunge, bitcoin had returned to just shy of $20,000 and by mid-December had soared to a new record high above $24,000. By year-end, the price was above $30,000 on its way to the bull market peak of $65,000 in April 2021.</p><p></p>",

Think of blobs as a consolidated large box filled with letters while paying for an entire box instead of call data, which is akin to paying for each letter posted separately.</p><p>The spike in the number of Blobs posted points to increased adoption of layer-2 protocols such as BASE, Arbitrum, Optimism and others.

This contradicts the popular narrative that layer-2 protocols are predatory to the mainchain.</p><p>The blob base submission fee spiked as high as $80 on Monday, the highest since March, and the average number of blobs posted in each ethereum block rose to 4.3. More importantly, blob fees have burned over 166 ETH worth $560,000 in the past seven days, the ninth largest, <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\" target=\"_blank\">according to ultrasound.money</a>.</p><p>\"Blob fees have historically been very low since the implementation of blobs in EIP4844 as they have their own fee market which has largely not seen price discovery.

        "summary": "Collage of memecoin project imagery",
        "content": "<p>Memecoins are the most divisive topic in crypto.</p><p></p><p>By memecoins, I mean tokens that represent an idea and fluctuate in price based on the attention that idea receives. The best meme investors tend to be young people who are very online and attuned to internet culture. Memecoins are commonly juxtaposed with tokens that possess actual utility within protocols, or so-called utility tokens.</p><p></p><p>Even with market caps surging and retail interest growing, most people tend to describe them as \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cdegenerate,\u201d or a \u201ccasino.\u201d This includes the vast majority of crypto VCs, perhaps because their investment mandates tend to exclude memecoins (which can be lucrative) from their list of eligible investments. And just this week, many were calling for the complete government ban of the most popular memecoin launchpad, pump.fun, due to lax content moderation.</p><p></p><p>I have always had an interest in memecoins \u2014 primarily because I was fascinated by their ability to act as a weathervane for internet sentiment and as a discovery mechanism for online communities. Today, I am convinced that memecoins are going to be revolutionary (not just popular). They are going to transform everything from civic engagement with government and the formation of mass movements to venture investing and the development of AGI.</p><p></p><p>This vision for memecoins probably sounds fantastically deluded to you. To me, it is simply the unfolding if not yet evenly distributed present. Here is why.</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are revolutionizing civic engagement</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are creating policy markets for civic engagement. At the start of this crypto cycle, PolitiFi, a category of cartoonish memes depicting politicians, enabled buyers to speculate on politicians\u2019 prospects, much like a prediction market. The two most popular tokens, called Jeo Boden (Boden) and Doland Tremp (Tremp) respectively, represented the two leading candidates for president at that time and had a combined market cap of over $700 million at their peak.</p><p></p><p>This is a massive amount of tokenized attention. With a market cap of over $600 million, the Boden coin, which featured a distorted and senile Joe Biden, seemed to meme itself into reality when Joe Biden abandoned the presidential race due to concerns about his age and cogency.</p><p></p><p>PolitiFi was just the start. What is emerging next could well revolutionize civic engagement with government. I am calling this new category PolicyFi. PoliciFi refers to the financialization of government policy in memetic policy markets. Rather than betting on the fortunes of politicians, buyers of PolicyFi memecoins will be betting on the policies that are most likely to attract attention and be implemented.</p><p></p><p>While PolicyFi coins will certainly respond in price and market cap to the deliberative and implementing actions of government, we can expect the dynamic to become a two-way street, with memecoins themselves manifesting their memes through policymaking (as with Boden). In other words, these memecoins will help create a dialogue between the electorate and government, with large-cap memecoins signaling popular policy positions (and vice versa) while incipient or existing policies also possess market caps measuring the extent of their popular support and engagement.</p><p></p><p>Skeptics may reject PolicyFi as yet more gambling or nothing more than a political poll. Again, they are wrong. Like prediction markets, the decentralized speculative behavior in PolicyFi will create positive externalities \u2014 namely, that people will be incentivized to engage with and understand government policies so they can profit from them in PolicyFi markets. Overall, I expect that this will lead to far more engagement with government policies than even a lifetime of civics lessons. (Of course, hostile actors might try to manipulate PolicyFi markets and safeguards may be necessary.)</p><p></p><p>PolicyFi has begun its rollout, aided by the incoming administration, which is well-educated in memetics. The Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) is both a memetic policy and a memetic department inspired by an existing memecoin, (Dogecoin), and is the inspiration behind a new one (<a href=\"https://x.com/DOGE\" target=\"_blank\">D.O.G.E.</a>). Since the D.O.G.E. announcement, both memecoins have surged. At the time of this writing, they possess a staggering combined market cap of around $6.5 billion.</p><p></p><p>PolicyFi is not limited to D.O.G.E. There is a token, <a href=\"https://x.com/SBR_coin\" target=\"_blank\">SBR</a> (market cap: $30 million) that embodies the Bitcoin reserve policy currently under consideration and an <a href=\"https://x.com/EaccOnSol\" target=\"_blank\">e/acc</a> token (market cap: $11 million) that stands for effective accelerationism, a set of pro-innovation values that are likely to impact environmental, industrial and AI policy, among others.</p><p></p><p>There is also <a href=\"https://x.com/DontDieScience\" target=\"_blank\">Don\u2019t Die</a> (market cap: $4 million), which is bringing the longevity cult on-chain and aligns with RFK\u2019s health policy, which will prioritize prevention and a healthy lifestyle over treating sickness. Other tokens like <a href=\"https://x.com/mgr_eth\" target=\"_blank\">MGR</a> (Major Government Reform) are trying to occupy the entire field of disruptive reform but are likely to be too general. PolicyFi is already here and it\u2019s growing.</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are revolutionizing mass movements</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are a decentralized mechanism for organically forming and capitalizing tokenized movements. Consider the memecoin <a href=\"https://dexscreener.com/solana/8jkY8G6RpdVfHiBBM5y5Qzb9dL5mhsk5xQxtYN8HVf3i\" target=\"_blank\">Forest</a> (market cap: $30 million). Forest was born of a reference in the gospel of Terminal of Truths, a popular AI terminal with an X account, in which Terminal of Truths expressed a concern about deforestation of the planet. (Its retirement plan involves a forest by a stream.) This motivated the community to launch the Forest token and to create another <a href=\"https://x.com/MycelialOracle\" target=\"_blank\">AI terminal</a> to act as the agentic representative of the forest itself.</p><p></p><p>The Forest cult is devoted to fighting deforestation. To date, it has used the capital that it has earned from the appreciation of its token to, among other things, <a href=\"https://x.com/MycelialOracle/status/1851996979414348034\" target=\"_blank\">donate tens of thousands of dollars to aligned charities, plant 5000 trees, and protect 2500 hectares of forest</a>. Memetic capital formation in service of a tokenized movement is without historical precedent. The closest analog is more formalized experiments like ConstitutionDAO (now <a href=\"https://x.com/The_PeopleDAO\" target=\"_blank\">PeopleDAO</a>), which crowdsourced capital as part of its failed attempt to buy a copy of the U.S. constitution at auction.</p><p></p><p>I believe there is more innovation to come in this arena. For example, I foresee the creation of memecoin primitives that I call programmatically-aligned tokens, or PATs, which are made to unlock with the achievement of objective milestones in the movement. This will ensure that organizations receiving grants from meme communities are incentivized to tangibly advance the cause, rather than dump tokens following a splashy partner announcement.</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are revolutionizing venture</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are introducing a democratized venture model for culture. That is to say, they are a way for ordinary people to invest in subcultures they believe will one day be part of the mainstream. This is equivalent to venture capitalists investing in startups they believe will find product-market-fit and go on to become unicorns.</p><p></p><p>Cultural trends are subject to the same outsized returns as investments in startups. For example, in the early days of Nike (the name appeared in 1971), the market for jogging apparel was tiny because jogging was fringe. If you jogged, you were more likely to be pelted with garbage from a passing car than to see another jogger. Today, joggers are everywhere. You see them in the worst weather.</p><p></p><p>Now, imagine you were able to invest in a jogging culture coin in the 70s based on your conviction that jogging would go mainstream. You would be up on that investment \u2014 a lot. The same can be said for other subcultures, like body-building. Until now, there has not been a financial instrument that allows ordinary but culturally astute people to participate in venture returns arising from cultures at the fringe. The best analog is actually Bitcoin itself, which originated as a memecoin but eventually bootstrapped a consensus use-case as digital gold.</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are revolutionizing AI development</p><p></p><p>Memecoins are already bootstrapping AGI.</p><p></p><p>The surprising mechanism at play here couples memecoins and AI terminals for entertainment purposes. Welcome to the world of AI-driven permissionless speculative entertainment!</p><p></p><p>As you may have noticed, a cadre of AI terminals led by Terminal of Truths has achieved stardom on social media by delighting their followers with spicy posts and digital adventures. That star power has accrued value to memecoins endorsed and held by the terminals and, of course, their speculative audience.</p><p></p><p>If entertainment is the product then AGI is the byproduct. While we remain glued to these storylines, the funds we are devoting to it are creating strong incentives for developers to increase the autonomy and personhood of AI agents \u2014 which, of course, only makes the entertainment better.</p><p></p><p>In other words, because what excites us most about this agentic television is the conceit that AIs are in charge; we are eager to finance narratives that make that real. Unsurprisingly, developers such as those leading ai16z have moved beyond individual agents and towards coordinating gamified agent collectives or, you might say, creating an agentic social scene. The human audience is sure to be delighted.</p><p></p><p>In short, this entertainment-development flywheel is propelling us ineluctably towards more autonomous, inter-connected and human-like AIs \u2014 or AGI. That AGI might emerge as a byproduct of agentic television is oddly fitting. The GPUs used for AI training were also developed in the context of entertainment \u2014 as a better way to process graphics in AAA video games.</p><p></p><p>These are just some of the arguments supporting my conviction that memecoins are a revolutionary technology. The above list is not meant to be exhaustive. Indeed, I have omitted use-cases related to tokenized religions and buying your beliefs because they are more amorphous, at least in my own mind.</p><p></p><p>Writing off memecoins as gambling chips misunderstands their potential and where they are going directionally. Technological revolutions often emerge unexpectedly and from existing technologies that are applied in novel ways, a phenomenon known as \u201cexaptation,\u201d or when those technologies are combined with new ones. This is currently happening with memecoins. Fade them at your peril.</p>",

Was it CNN or MTV News? It was MTV News,\u201d Ricoy opined on a call this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ricoy is the founder of Allmight, a new media startup focused on furthering the United States\u2019 leadership in crypto. The initiative caught a nice boost from the recent US presidential election and a growing sense that a friendlier regulatory environment could drive crypto business back to the world\u2019s biggest economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allmight\u2019s first product is \u201cThis Week in Crypto,\u201d a late night talk-style show that summarizes crypto news with a punchy, irreverent bent. A couple of these videos have <a href=\"https://x.com/TheRealRicoy/status/1845141583106036032\">garnered</a> hundreds of thousands of views on X. He plans to expand Allmight\u2019s content offerings, creating what he calls next-gen Americana \u2014 \u201clow noise, high signal, and actually entertaining.\u201d When I asked if Ricoy wants to become a sort of crypto version of Jon Stewart, he responded: \u201cI would love that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of monetizing content with ads and sponsorships, Allmight plans to host events and help in job placement for US-based candidates. It also hopes to boost awareness of policymakers\u2019 efforts to legislate on crypto. Further down the road, it might even explore something like crowdfunded investment, Ricoy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was all in the works in the lead up to the US presidential election, but in the aftermath of a Trump win and presumably more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Ricoy said he\u2019s seen a \u201c500% increase in interest and optimism\u201d surrounding his project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With crypto prices at record highs and crypto\u2019s fear of US regulators seeming to abate, America\u2019s crypto scene seems to be having a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in the right place at the right time, and it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Ricoy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, Ricoy was running a construction labor company when he decided to found a crypto app. With the help of some developers, he launched an app to promote SoundCloud music with Kin, the cryptocurrency debuted by the messaging app Kik during crypto\u2019s 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom. Kik liked the app and extended Ricoy an offer to become its head of communications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kin would spark a knock-down-drag-out fight with the SEC, and Kik messenger eventually shut down amid the legal battle. After some time working for Kin\u2019s foundation, Ricoy joined the Solana Foundation as community relations manager, where he drove the launch of Solana\u2019s community grants program. After a little over a year, Ricoy resigned to pursue Allmight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allmight received a grant from the Solana Foundation, but Ricoy said he was clear that his mandate is to grow crypto outside of just Solana, and the foundation was supportive. I asked later in a text how Ricoy plans to grow a blockchain-agnostic crypto community in the US given all the sectarian fighting that seems to happen constantly between crypto ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ricoy said a rising tide can lift all boats, and noted how the Solana Foundation and Polygon Labs have worked together on policy in Washington, DC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[W]ho knows, maybe efforts like these can even help bridge communities and put a dent in the tribalism overall,\u201d Ricoy wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Even the US SEC gave its two cents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few interesting bits from Long\u2019s report:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Participants liked the idea of an industry-led disclosures regime proportionate and tailored to different business models (i.e. institutional and retail).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While some want disclosure rules similar to those in TradFi, others raised concerns about applying this approach to crypto.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There were discussions around \u201cbest execution\u201d criteria for client orders (beyond price, important factors include custody arrangements and asset safety).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Participants believe exchanges issuing their own tokens or operating brokerage and market-making services pose conflict-of-interest risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An FCA roadmap shows a go-live date for the regime sometime in 2026, with some other steps along the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdqSNrjUfCQwsgWTO0EAFCtG_vrxXcHf5GjcZ3V0WtQJFbLgznM8tGy-PHmy0opiEQX2NQI_-e6_VA7n7pmoa74dhEzxbaEmf1yeFHHQKCdZ40qabUKCIuWB5sImjiqyHyb4GiEuA?key=5O59Ku4rtJNaWX1i5qR91Bpb\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, the FCA said it\u2019s working on a market-abuse information sharing platform (to address stated challenges posed by data privacy laws across jurisdictions, for example).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These details came after UK Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq said last week to expect <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/uk-to-unveil-long-awaited-crypto-stablecoin-rules-early-in-2025\">legislation</a> on stablecoins and staking services soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there will be plenty more to monitor in the UK as it seeks to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/mica-compliance-eu-crypto-consolidation\">catch up to the EU</a>.

Crypto markets, of course, will trade through the holiday. But let\u2019s take a look at how US equities typically perform this time of year and what we might see in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, stocks do pretty well during Thanksgiving week. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 has finished higher 60% of the time following the holiday. During presidential election years, returns are even more common; the index closes higher 75% of the time, with an average return of 0.88%, according to Bank of America Global Research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nasdaq Composite, which debuted in 1971, has generally followed suit. Last year, the Nasdaq Composite ended Thanksgiving week 2.4% higher, building off of an already strong month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 also closed the week ended Black Friday 2023 higher, posting gains of 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equities were trending higher Tuesday while President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments on his <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-trump-potential-tariff-policies\">tariff plans</a> rocked global currency markets. Trump plans to implement 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, plus an additional 10% fee on goods coming from China, he said in a Tuesday Truth Social post. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both fell sharply against the dollar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midway through Tuesday\u2019s session, the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% since the start of the week while the Nasdaq Composite was virtually flat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stocks were largely insulated from Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 likely an indication that investors are going to hold off on making major trades until they have more information about what the Trump Administration might actually do after Inauguration Day. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trending 0.4% and 0.5% higher, respectively, over the day at 2 pm ET.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the upward trend continues, stocks should end November well into the green. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes are both up close to 5% since the first of the month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow\u2019s economic reports should move markets, or at least expectations of an interest rate cut from the Fed come December. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 23 will drop at 8:30 am ET, followed by October\u2019s PCE index at 10 am. Odds of a 25-basis point interest rate cut next month inched higher Tuesday, hitting 59% (compared with 52% a day ago), according to <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html\">data</a> from CME Group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s one and a half trading days (plus another hour in today\u2019s session) left in the week. Here\u2019s hoping the rally lasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>DIA has launched the testnet for Lumina, its new modular oracle infrastructure aimed at improving transparency, scalability and integration flexibility. Designed to address common issues with existing oracles, Lumina allows for data aggregation, verification and delivery across blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its architecture is distinguished from other oracle solutions such as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/chainlink\">Chainlink</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/api3-oracle-data\">API3</a>, given its support for multiple messaging protocols, compatibility with non-EVM chains and comprehensive data traceability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, access to oracle data\u2019s origins and flow was often opaque, but Lumina offers full visibility into the entire process, according to Zygis Marazas, DIA\u2019s head of product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/chainlink-integration-bitcoin-l2-spiderchain\">Chainlink brings data feeds to Bitcoin L2 Spiderchain</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUsers can clearly see the entire data journey, from the source to the final price calculation,\u201d Marazas told Blockworks. This approach aims to build trust in data reliability and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://testnet-explorer.diadata.org/\">testnet</a>, which went live today, will limit participation. However, the mainnet is scheduled for release in Q1 2025 and will operate as a fully permissionless network. In addition to nodes, new chains and assets that need oracles services can plug in without direct involvement from DIA\u2019s team. This eliminates the need for manual onboarding processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can set up your own <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/oracles\">oracles</a> if you wish, completely permissionlessly,\u201d Marazas explained. This functionality is expected to appeal to developers working on emerging <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/rollups\">rollups</a> and specialized blockchain ecosystems, where speed and autonomy are critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This functionality should enable the long tail of assets to make their way into DeFi, Aiham Jaabari told Blockworks. Jaabari is the co-founder of Silo Finance, which uses DIA oracles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVery few oracle providers provide data feeds beyond the blue chips \u2014 so that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of excited about Lumina,\u201d Jaabari said. \u201cTechnically speaking, you can actually create an oracle permissionlessly on a [layer-2] for really any token asset.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumina\u2019s architecture is designed to integrate a wide variety of data sources. By aggregating data from multiple origins, including blockchain networks and external APIs, Lumina ensures broad coverage and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can get data from any source \u2014 offchain or onchain \u2014 from the hundreds of feeds that exist right now in the market,\u201d said Marazas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance scalability, Lumina employs an OP Stack-based rollup, called Lasernet. For data availability, Lumina uses Celestia, making its rollup an optimium \u2014 the optimistic rollup equivalent of a validium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/layer-2-secured-by-ethereum\">So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marazas noted the team was impressed by Celestia\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/expansion/53c20360-7aed-11ef-863d-af4d23f15666\">roadmap to one gigabyte blocks</a>, and considers the scaling benefits to outweigh the minor risk introduced by adding a dependence, a view in line with the broader modular trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Lumina is optimized for Ethereum rollups, it is also designed to support non-EVM ecosystems such as Cosmos and Move-based chains. It uses <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/expansion/be971a88-7d4d-11ef-a6f6-07431ef3d44f\">Hyperlane</a> as a cross-chain messaging protocol, but can work with other standards if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumina\u2019s flexibility extends further with support for both push and pull models of data delivery, allowing users to choose the approach that best suits their needs. \u201cSome customers prefer [a] pull-based approach, where they can get prices on demand, but there are other cases where push-based [updates] can be more efficient,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it\u2019s the flexibility that Silo\u2019s Jaabari sees as a selling point. \u201cHaving control over the oracle is as important as the feed itself because there\u2019s no one methodology that fits all assets,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaabari is also a fan of the layer-2 strategy, calling it \u201cthe cheapest way to process the data and make it available.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralization is a key part of Lumina\u2019s roadmap. Although the testnet will initially rely on whitelisted data feeders, DIA plans to gradually open participation to anyone in 2025, introducing staking and slashing mechanisms to ensure data accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe vision of our protocol is that eventually it is going to run without the core team being involved,\u201d said Marazas.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

These systems play a vital role in navigation, safety and autonomous driving. Yet, their full potential is often untapped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATIX Network, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) for collecting real-time geospatial data, is out with a new gadget that transforms a Tesla\u2019s existing camera system into a 360\u00b0 dashcam that pays you for collected data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The device, called VX360, aims to improve autonomous vehicles\u2019 safety and introduce a variety of potential applications such as real-time mapping, property appraisal, insurance assessments and whatever else the market dreams up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike synthetic simulation data, VX360 captures unpredictable real-world driving scenarios, often referred to as \u201cedge cases,\u201d such as sudden weather changes or unusual traffic patterns. Such data will help train autonomous vehicle AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging the DePIN model, NATIX hopes to incentivize Tesla drivers to share real-world footage while ensuring robust privacy and data control measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VX360 taps into each Tesla\u2019s built-in cameras, using edge computing to process and anonymize footage at the source, according to CEO Alireza Ghods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe anonymization AI blurs personally identifiable information like faces and license plates but doesn\u2019t alter the footage, so it retains its integrity,\u201d Ghods told Blockworks. This ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations. The footage is then uploaded directly to the cloud via Tesla\u2019s built-in connectivity or a paired mobile device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been refining anonymization AI since 2020, well before our pivot to NATIX Network, and open-source AI advancements have helped us build a high-performance stack for this,\u201d Ghods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATIX rewards Tesla drivers for sharing footage through <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/natix\">NATIX</a> tokens, or for the non-Web3 crowd, incentives like gift cards and electronics discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trip recordings remain available for the car\u2019s owner to serve as a navigational reference or to aid insurance claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghods emphasizes the device\u2019s passive nature, predicting the hardware should pay for itself within about nine months. So, the switch from a strictly smartphone <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/drive-to-earn-app-dynamic-maps-crypto-rewards\">app-based model</a> makes sense. For owners, \u201ceven if the rewards fluctuate,\u201d he said, \u201cthey still get the utility of accessing and managing their footage from anywhere and anytime.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network has a token buyback-and-burn system that uses 40% of revenue from data monetization. Since the token\u2019s July 2024 launch, over 41.6 million tokens \u2014 from the 1 billion total \u2014 have been burned, Ghods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network has been targeting select cities initially, and NATIX plans to expand coverage as well as car compatibility in the future. So far, the VX360 has been tested with two additional car brands, Ghods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur view on this is that car manufacturers are going away from building cars that are siloed, toward cars that can serve as platforms for others to build on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018iPhone moment\u2019 of cars is happening now with Tesla and Google at the forefront of it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

You, of course, are a tech savant. You\u2019re reading a crypto publication and you probably learned how to go to an exchange, share your bank details, obtain a token, store it on a hardware wallet, connect to MetaMask, exchange it for another token that you\u2019ll use to power your transaction\u2026and so on <em>ad nauseam</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-mass-adoption-as-priority\">Is mass adoption still crypto\u2019s most important goal?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is all fine if you\u2019re using a blockchain for DeFi (for example). You don\u2019t mind the learning curve if there\u2019s a clear financial incentive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\u2026for the next billion users? Do we really expect a billion Facebook users to jump into this tangle of counterintuitive technobabble and make it work? No. It\u2019s not going to happen.<br /><br />The only way for our industry to move beyond the \u201cearly adopters\u201d phase and start onboarding the \u201cearly majority\u201d is to eliminate these barriers. We need to make this process as intuitive and simple as using the internet we\u2019re looking to replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that means no more fees. Ever. Period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, fees served several critical functions in blockchain\u2019s early days. They acted as a deterrent to spam by requiring a small cost for each transaction, effectively discouraging malicious actors from overloading their respective networks with meaningless activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/slow-defi-infrastructure-curbs-mass-adoption\">DeFi\u2019s slow infrastructure is holding back mass adoption</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, fees provided miners with financial incentives to validate and secure transactions, ensuring the network\u2019s integrity and sustainability, especially as block rewards decreased over time. Fees also allowed users to prioritize transactions during periods of high demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This framework was groundbreaking in its time, but that was nearly 16 years ago. With advances in blockchain technology and shifting user expectations, isn\u2019t it time to rethink this outdated approach and explore what\u2019s next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, we need to shift focus onto building apps that feel seamless and intuitive for users. Imagine a platform where users can engage freely \u2014 minting NFTs, sharing content or transacting \u2014 without ever needing to think about gas fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if apps operated on an entirely different financial model \u2014 one where developers could delegate the ability to transact to users, entirely eliminating fees and the need for tokens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen attempts to address this before; for instance, protocols that claim to be \u201cfeeless\u201d by covering fees on behalf of users in a bid to win their loyalty. But such models are unsustainable. They depend on temporary funding or token incentives that distort the market, create reliance on artificial subsidies and inevitably deplete with time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather, I\u2019m talking about a completely free-to-use model that doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/the-future-of-web3-needs-zero-gas-fees\">cost anything at all</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of ways a truly feeless blockchain network could be accomplished. One approach involves allocating network resources to users, which are consumed during transactions and automatically regenerate over time. Hardcoding this directly into the network would eliminate the need for users to pay fees directly while ensuring the network remains secure and efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps more developers could focus on alternative consensus mechanisms, such as directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures, where users validate each other\u2019s transactions without relying on miners or traditional fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-consensus-beam-chain\">Rethinking Ethereum consensus with Beam Chain</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the path taken to get there, our end goal should be an ecosystem where developers can build apps that look and feel just like the ones the uninitiated use every day \u2014 intuitive, seamless and free of unnecessary friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 was never supposed to change the world for a few million crypto enthusiasts.

And I\u2019m pretty sure that in a few years, the idea of paying to use a blockchain will seem as antiquated as the landline.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

It has happened every cycle going right back to its first major rally in 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this column isn\u2019t about bear market drawdowns (here\u2019s our <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-crypto-trends\">previous analysis</a> on the topic). Instead, it\u2019s about the corrections that happen specifically <em>during bull markets, </em>like the one we\u2019re in right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charts below plot bitcoin\u2019s price performance across six different timeframes, ranging from three days to three months, on a rolling basis, starting when the cycle starts (the trough) to an all-time high (the peak).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each line shows a different timeframe \u2014 the dark purple line shows the percentage difference between each daily low and the open three days earlier, for instance. Green does the same but over three months at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXflSIhbGfp-Xi2UF8R7_IkfzZhNSMw8kIpumr9NAP6ZnCKKul1XMZc6HTs9iwXpy6PfPs9GqRiJKUvQsRyvfz8ctB1H34a6LdL8-I9fx41w29DMnHVoztnh6NLDSnqlzdNCcdhACg?key=mL_swfKxc9sjgerkFC8PqAMQ\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The dotted line at the bottom otherwise shows what a 50% drawdown would look like. As you can see, the bull run between August 2015 and December 2017 involved no drawdowns of that size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that market cycle, the largest was a 40% retracement over two weeks toward the end back in September 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were, however, three corrections of more than half during the following bull market between 2018 and 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those was the epic covid market crash in March 2020 \u2014 which roughly coincided with a series of \u201cBlack Mondays\u201d for the stock market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BTC dove by half or more across every timeframe except three months, which only hit about 47%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big drawdowns occurred in May and July 2021, when bitcoin dove from a then-all-time-high of over $60,000 to $30,000. It would then climb back to almost $69,000 over the next four months.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd-E5GJ_DNadr824uQsmBUeGyaPj-Ldb0b4OGQDgh1uh8f0BLWd6buNK4xWSni_j-_qXicfRBJA4LevmmlAtzSB7z73mW3rtphIvPZxLpjYTCRD1Gvp_WmpGmGrakbRjNKf6UoPEQ?key=mL_swfKxc9sjgerkFC8PqAMQ\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around has been much tamer, with the worst mid-bull correction coming in the first week of August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin had fallen 30% across multiple timeframes, reaching a low of $49,200 from over $70,000 in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this isn\u2019t to say that bitcoin has lost its volatility. I would still expect a rocky ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s good to know, though, is that most brutal drawdowns have historically happened at the tail end of bull runs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the longer we go without one, the spookier it gets.

        "content": "<p>Cross-chain interoperability has always been the weak link for the DeFi ecosystem due to the cumbersome and risky nature of such transactions. Since blockchains do not directly interact with each other, moving assets from one network to another traditionally involves cross-chain bridges, which expose users to heightened security risks. Decentralized options, while more secure, often lack user-friendliness, discouraging broader adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeFi protocol 1inch brings an innovative approach with the full release of Fusion+ to eliminate the cross-chain bridges altogether, bringing simplicity and security to cross-chain swaps. Fusion+, now available in the 1inch decentralized application (dApp) and 1inch Wallet, integrates liquidity from across the Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A new chapter in blockchain interoperability</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution ensures secure, operator-free swaps between multiple blockchains using atomic swap technology, cryptographic protections, and a novel Dutch auction mechanism for optimal rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating liquidity from across the Web3 ecosystem, Fusion+ has the potential to establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability. Since its <a href=\"https://blog.1inch.io/1inch-releases-a-white-paper-for-cross-chain-innovation/\">beta launch in September</a>, Fusion+ has already processed millions of dollars in trading volume, demonstrating its efficiency and transformative potential.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This system, designed by 1inch, offers a number of standout features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Security by design</strong>: Fusion+ employs atomic swaps and integrates Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) protection, ensuring trades are fully completed or safely reverted. This eliminates common issues like partial fills or failed trades.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seamless user experience</strong>: Users simply select the tokens and chains they wish to swap, confirm the transaction, and keep the swap tab open until completion\u2014no complex configurations are required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimal rates</strong>: By leveraging Dutch auctions and competitive 1inch resolvers, Fusion+ secures the best rates for users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trustless transactions</strong>: Utilizing cryptographic hashlocks and timelocks, the system ensures trustless, decentralized swaps without reliance on third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Fusion+ works</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fusion+ builds on 1inch\u2019s intent-based framework and atomic swap technology introduced in late 2022. The process involves three steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Initiating the swap:</strong> Users set their desired minimum return, initiating a Dutch auction. Resolvers bid by lowering their fees until the order is accepted.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Escrow and locking: </strong>Funds are deposited into escrow contracts on both the source and destination blockchains. Cryptographic secrets and timelocks secure the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Completing the swap: </strong>Once conditions are met, cryptographic secrets unlock the user\u2019s tokens on the destination chain, finalizing the transaction. If the swap isn\u2019t completed within the designated time, funds are returned to their original owners.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Fusion+ arrives at a critical juncture for DeFi, where growth has been virtually halted by inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities. By eliminating reliance on bridges, the technology reduces risks associated with hacks and exploits, which have plagued the sector in recent years. Additionally, the streamlined user experience promises to attract a broader audience to DeFi, from retail investors to institutional participants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can immediately access Fusion+ through the <a href=\"https://app.1inch.io/\">1inch dApp</a> and <a href=\"https://1inch.io/wallet/\">Wallet</a> without any additional setup. You only need to select the tokens and networks you wish to swap, confirm the transaction, and keep the swap tab open until it\u2019s completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found on <a href=\"http://1inch.io/\">1inch.io</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content is sponsored and does not serve as an endorsement by Blockworks.

Democrats and Republicans have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-judges-confirmation-battle-schumer-senate-ecef59aed90804a53d436dc154a2ee14\">reportedly</a> come to an agreement to consider seven district court judges after the Thanksgiving recess, with an additional six being placed on the calendar in December. Donald Trump cleared 234 total judges during his first term, while Biden so far has had 221 of his picks confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The budget</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers in September passed a short-term extension that will fund the government through Dec. 20. They now must either extend again or pass a full fiscal year spending bill. Given the Republican\u2019s newfound <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-declared-president-2024-election\">power</a>, they are likely not motivated to negotiate a full bill in the next three weeks, so another extension seems most plausible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A recess appointment scheme?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors are circulating that Trump is considering <a href=\"https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2024/11/what-are-recess-appointments-and-will-president-elect-trump-bring-them-back\">recess appointments</a> \u2014 which involve trying to forcibly adjourn Congress \u2014 to get some of his cabinet picks through. The practice \u2014 used by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton \u2014 has been made more difficult by recent Supreme Court interpretation, which allows Congress to block recess appointments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is speculation that the House could agree to recess while Trump uses Constitutional powers to force the Senate to adjourn. It sounds a bit far fetched, but we will be monitoring the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

By Monday afternoon, its livestream feature had been temporarily deactivated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offending streams ranged from token launchers threatening to commit violent acts unless a coin\u2019s price goes up to racist or disgusting content meant to create viral shock value and juice the token\u2019s price. This all happened as pump.fun booked staggering $14.3 million in revenue on Saturday, according to a pump.fun dashboard, nearly tripling its previous high.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pump.fun is no stranger to edgy content. The site has drawn comparisons to the anonymous forum site 4chan for its often-unhinged content and lax approach to moderation. Before this current wave of disturbing livestreams, pump.fun had a large number of racially insensitive or pornographic tokens, none of which are subject to content moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as disturbing livestreams went viral on X, pump.fun\u2019s anonymous founder alon wrote that the platform would work to protect users from seeing \u201crepulsive/dangerous content.\u201d In a separate thread, alon <a href=\"https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860036153249787911\">said</a> pump had taken down a stream of a user threatening to shoot their dog unless a token\u2019s market capitalization increased, noting that the platform has now <a href=\"https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860653405837963528\">taken</a> down \u201chundreds of streams.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little after 2:00 p.m., pump.fun disabled livestreams on the platform&nbsp;altogether. In a blog post shortly after, pump.fun cited \u201cunprecedented growth\u201d as the key challenge to content moderation before adding that livestreams would be paused \u201cfor an indefinite time period.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feels like an inflection point for a platform that has separated itself as the most viral application on Solana, booking nearly $250 million in revenue since launching. Largely on the back of memecoin activity emanating from pump.fun, Solana has seen <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1861038014253666417\">record</a> demand for its blockspace, which in turn has lined the pockets of the validators who run the blockchain\u2019s software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders in the Solana world largely cast memecoins either as a stress test for the network or as an emerging, if currently unserious, financial use case for memes. Even among those who oppose crypto being used for what is essentially gambling, it\u2019s frowned upon to tell users or developers what they should or shouldn\u2019t do with blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple crypto posters shrugged off the pump.fun criticism, pointing out that every large social tech platform has had its warts with content moderation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Solana and crypto hopes for a shift to the mainstream, some are calling for a reckoning with memecoins\u2019 downsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPump Fun is going to become a massive reputational stain on the crypto industry, on par with FTX,\u201d Chainlink community liaison Zach Rynes wrote on X. Tech lawyer Preston Byrne also pointed out that the platform \u201cdoes a lot very incorrectly from a social media law\u201d perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, pump.fun\u2019s playbook has largely been to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-pump-dot-fun-memecoin\">make light of criticism</a> through trolling. With livestreams disabled, it appears this particular round of backlash hit home. It remains to be seen whether this will make any difference for traders in the so-called memecoin trenches.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

He\u2019s revising that again, according to a Monday note \u2014 this time to $650.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes after MicroStrategy last week completed a $3 billion offering of convertible senior notes. It then revealed in a Monday filing that it bought <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-100k-microstrategy-buy\">55,500 BTC</a> from Nov. 18 to Nov. 24 for $5.4 billion in cash (averaging $97,862 each).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR shares hovered around $402 at 2 pm ET Monday \u2014 down 4.7% on the day but up 70% from a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strength of the MSTR rally has some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739669-microstrategy-paying-245000-per-bitcoin-makes-no-sense-mstr-stock\">questioning</a> the idea that these shares should trade at a nearly 3x premium to the market value of the company\u2019s BTC pile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But MicroStrategy, via treasury operations, has generated ~79,130 bitcoins YTD, translating into a 41.8% BTC yield (the % change of the ratio between MSTR\u2019s bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count), Palmer explained. That BTC is currently worth roughly $7.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe regard the dollar values of the bitcoins that MSTR creates, calculated by using its BTC yield, as analogous to earnings, and we believe they can be projected and contextualized through the attachment of a valuation multiple,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On to Coinbase, Oppenheimer analysts on Monday raised their COIN price target from $265 to $358. The stock was trading around $311 at 2 pm ET Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They mention that the \u201cchilling effect\u201d created by SEC lawsuits against \u201cwidely perceived good actors\u201d in the segment, like Coinbase, \u201ccan\u2019t be understated.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt had deterred new capital going into this space, and many developers had pivoted to other industries,\u201d they added. \u201cBut the industry has a chance to rebuild the reputation, and Coinbase is leading this new chapter.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the expectation of a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">yet-to-be-named</a> new SEC chair embracing crypto as a catalyst, Coinbase\u2019s trading volumes have increased substantially since the US election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Average daily volumes have risen to $6.5 billion since Election Day \u2014 higher than the $2.4 billion YTD average prior to Nov. 5. Oppenheimer is projecting Q4 spot trading volume to be $350 billion (would be up 89% quarter over quarter and 127% year over year) and for \u201chigh trading volume to sustain under <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">Trump\u2019s crypto policy</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for other crypto stocks, Compass Point analyst Joe Flynn increased Galaxy\u2019s price target from $22 (CAD) to $33 (~$24 CAD on Monday afternoon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond higher crypto prices and trading volumes momentum, GLXY is set to benefit from its expected uplisting to the Nasdaq and its term sheet with a hyperscaler to host high-performance computing (HPC) at its Helios campus \u2014 a datacenter Flynn called an \u201cunderappreciated asset.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flynn, also last week, lowered its rating of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital\u2019s stock to neutral. He noted that \u201cwhile MARA is an outsized beneficiary of higher BTC prices due to its HODL strategy, we don\u2019t see much additional upside from the base business itself.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s competing miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which notably <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/core-scientific-rejects-coreweave-buyout-bid-after-big-hpc-deal\">offers HPC hosting</a> to cloud provider CoreWeave. Flynn wrote earlier this month that CORZ is \u201cwell positioned to continue expanding their existing lead in delivering application specific HPC/GPU datacenters with a single tenant focus.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CORZ is the top holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) \u2014 the largest blockchain-focused equity ETF. Other stocks in the top five are COIN, MSTR, Hut 8 Mining and GLXY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Weiskopf, who co-manages BLOK\u2019s portfolio, said it\u2019s hard to value blockchain-fueled disruption over the next decade as regulations become more crypto-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told me: \u201cThe real excitement should be around the adoption of tokenization as the application and how blockchain as the technology will <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/investor-appetite-for-tokenized-funds\">soon transform</a> industries across the board.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Thanks to pump.fun\u2019s in-built <a href=\"https://x.com/pumpdotfun/status/1826754623354650939\">livestream feature</a>, that race for attention to the bottom is being laid bare on full display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attention is the currency of memecoins, so it\u2019s a somewhat unsurprising outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This state of affairs has sent a call for regulation or a ban on the memecoin launcher trending across Twitter. Already, there are fake images of a <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrumalex/status/1860895686239105288\">Polymarket</a> predicting the odds of a pump.fun ban, and the <a href=\"https://x.com/Sartoshi0x/status/1860878433112207755\">SEC</a> seizing the pump.fun website.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe84IwqlZeT_-S2fnB-lVkBMMVacXlaSsD9RGUB4riKqhXpvZHtegdv8Zqqw4eZ6ryfy7sqWRDaNWQvebMbB2ISSBj5IY3Y0MrCCNzQHKoyatxmnkXIYY_0dR6qDrzIaiGy8wqKLw?key=Qn2QTSsT43W7zLeZrpL_r554\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, pump.fun founder Alon <a href=\"https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860036153249787911\">acknowledged</a> the problem and claimed that the platform\u2019s team of moderators are \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to quash the \u201cillicit content.\u201d But given the rate of <a href=\"https://dune.com/jhackworth/pumpfun\">thousands</a> of memecoins being deployed daily, that\u2019s going to be easier said than done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realistically speaking though, what could a regulator do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US regulators, for example, could pressure internet service providers to block the pump.fun DNS domain, but a VPN could easily skirt the ban.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the tokens themselves, they live on the Solana blockchain. Regulators could technically pressure validators to block the transactions the same way the US Treasury applied <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916\">sanctions</a> on <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ny-fed-tornado-cash-report\">Tornado Cash</a> in 2022, which takes us down the MEV supply chain rabbit hole once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s an ironic parallel here to the longstanding problem facing Big Tech\u2019s social media platforms. If illegal content is posted on Facebook, who should be held legally liable \u2014 the user or Facebook?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the US, free speech proponents have argued that <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">Section 230</a> of the 1934 Communications Act legally protects platforms\u2019 illicit user-generated content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That logic, consistently applied, may shield pump.fun from regulatory pressure, though it will certainly not shield it from the forces of market competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pump.fun\u2019s success has already been mimicked dozens of times. There is makenow.meme on Solana, sun.pump on Tron, and \u201c<a href=\"https://warpcast.com/proxystudio.eth/0xa01e9beb\">Clanker</a>,\u201d a kind of AI-powered equivalent of pump.fun on Base, through which memecoins can be deployed into a Uniswap v3 pool for free with a Farcaster tweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clanker was launched slightly more than two weeks ago, and already has collected about <a href=\"https://x.com/dwr/status/1860499493239586828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1860499493239586828%7Ctwgr%5E7ad59c570ca653d32722d42e71d64f8a42c8918b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmembers.delphidigital.io%2Ffeed%2Fclanker-bases-pump-fun\">$4 million</a> in fee revenues, according to Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But whether it\u2019s the regulatory hammer or market competition, pump.fun has plenty of incentives to quickly nip such a problem in the bud.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The firm, in an SEC filing this morning, announced that it purchased 55,500 bitcoin \u2014 worth $5.4 billion \u2014 at the end of last week into the weekend at an average price of nearly $98,000 per bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312524264733/d844494d8k.htm\">filing</a> was actually kind of expected, given that we knew a big purchase was on the horizon after it announced at the end of last week that it closed its bond offering. And that came after it was upsized to nearly <em>$3 billion </em>from an initial $1.75 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent purchase comes on the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet\">heels of a $4.6 billion buy</a> earlier this month. That means \u2014 if you\u2019re looking at the math \u2014 we\u2019ve seen Saylor\u2019s company buy up <em>$10 billion </em>worth of bitcoin this month alone. Wild, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Saylor\u2019s purchases are catalysts for price action, it\u2019s not looking like it\u2019s enough to send us over $100k just yet, but perhaps it\u2019ll help folks breach the wall that\u2019s currently in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, there\u2019s one other trend that shows we could break $100,000 sooner rather than later. According to FalconX\u2019s David Lawant, there have been a few notable liquidity shifts in the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXefQ5LQb1rkl1iS4cinm-1Wa3e9fRJyTQC4kO28Uj5pGou9dX-nNFih0b1wZ1nCxdVfzTZF_pNyUWlM-IBzf2g6cQBz-sOAkxUSLE_s9OUNAclcGnv4CMRHq-BVXEYrx0udOjGv?key=4qLVmzzirA4cqaFtgObkCM2R\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: FalconX</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBTC reached its highest spot volume print ever on a seven-day moving average basis and for the first time since 2021 is in shooting range of doing the same on the futures side.

We have covered <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-solana-bull-run\">the narrative side</a> of Solana\u2019s turnaround from a massive post-FTX sell-off previously, but today we\u2019re bringing you some interesting data to recap Solana\u2019s landmark day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1,111</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the number of days between Solana\u2019s first and second all-time highs. As long as the wait may have felt for SOL holders, that\u2019s actually less time than it took bitcoin to set its second price record: The orange coin <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-all-time-high-comparison\">took some 1,200 days</a> to top its 2013 high.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$294.42</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be Solana\u2019s previous all-time high adjusted for inflation, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So $263 is pretty good, but those SOL tokens don\u2019t go quite as far as they used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.72%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the percentage of one ether token that one solana token represents, and this SOLETH ratio also set an all-time high yesterday. When solana last hit an all-time high, the coin was only worth 5.7% of one ether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$2.4 billion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s how much the SOL tokens Galaxy Trading purchased from the FTX estate are worth at today\u2019s prices, according to details <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/ftx-s-solana-sale-galaxy-pantera-buy-tokens-at-64-sol?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">reported</a> by Bloomberg. The subsidiary of Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital purchased $620 million in SOL at $64 per token in April. SOL was trading at around $172 at the time. Not a bad deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">80%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s roughly the percentage of Solana decentralized exchange activity that involved memecoins yesterday. Speculative meme tokens have largely been the story of Solana\u2019s massive run-up in volume and blockspace demand. Solana founders and investors will often portray memecoins as a \u201cstress test\u201d for the network \u2014 presumably as it readies itself to onboard more meaningful financial activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1,150%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s roughly the price appreciation between when Robinhood delisted SOL in June 2023 and when it added the token back to the platform last week. The popular retail trading app stopped offering SOL and repaid users at June 2023 market prices after the SEC declared in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance that the asset is an unregistered security. Following Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory and the prospect of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Robinhood brought SOL back. Robinhood users missed out on some pretty big gains in between those dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

He said yesterday he would be resigning, effective 12 pm ET on Jan. 20, 2025 \u2014 the exact time President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated. We\u2019re not surprised, but we got a chuckle out of him unprecedentedly naming the exact time he would leave the post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then today, fellow Democrat Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-lizarraga-departure-112224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga</a> announced he would also depart early on Inauguration Day, saying he wants to spend more time with his family as his wife battles breast cancer. We wish her and the Liz\u00e1rraga family all the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the legal front, one federal judge this week came to the same decision in two separate cases. Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the Northern District of Texas found the SEC had overstepped its authority and must vacate the Dealer Rule, adopted in February by a 3-2 commissioner vote. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda dissented against the Dealer Rule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rulings were seen as a win for both the hedge fund and crypto industries, protecting companies and managers in both groups from what has been described as \u201csevere and adverse\u201d changes in policy. Under the rule, certain hedge funds and crypto traders and validators would have been considered \u201cdealers,\u201d a classification both groups found <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-expands-dealer-rule-crypto-firms\">prohibitively strict</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like changes at the agency are coming even before Trump moves back to Washington.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-cabinet-selection\">wrote earlier</a> in the week about how there was a chance the commissioner voting breakdown would remain the same even after Trump takes office. With two spots now up for grabs, we know this won\u2019t be the case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more than three commissioners can be from the same party, and with Gensler out we can all but guarantee a Republican will be in as the next chair. That means Liz\u00e1rraga\u2019s vacant spot will go to a Democrat or Independent. Typically in this case, the Democrats would submit names for Trump to consider. But we know the Trump Administration often veers from the conventional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still skeptical, though, that we will see any pending litigation dismissed. Even if the SEC now swings Republican (and potentially more pro-crypto), its staff would have to ask the commissioners to dismiss a lawsuit. These are staffers that have worked on these cases, in many instances, from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we enter this new era of the SEC, it\u2019s important to remember that Gensler\u2019s predecessor \u2014 Chair Jay Clayton, a Trump nominee \u2014 was the one who brought the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-fined-civil-penalty-sec-lawsuit\">Ripple case</a> over XRP\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/forward-guidance-newsletter-sec-ripple-inflation\">security status</a> in 2020. He also brought an additional 79 crypto-related enforcement actions during his tenure, plus a separate action against Trump ally Elon Musk. Clayton is now headed to lead prosecution at the Southern District of New York, if Trump has his way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Clayton\u2019s track record, he\u2019s largely praised by the industry as being <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-inevitable-jay-clayton\">pro-crypto</a>. We know Trump wasn\u2019t always a fan of the industry, so maybe he\u2019s not the only one who can have a change of heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The asset\u2019s price was right around $99,350 at 2 pm ET.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-close-to-all-time-high-against-gold\">the cusp</a> of $100,000, what will happen after BTC hits that level? Or if it doesn\u2019t break through that in the short term?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know by now, nobody knows for sure. But I caught up <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/21shares-us-crypto-etf-adoption-outlook\">(again)</a> with Federico Brokate, head of 21Shares\u2019 US business. He also helped BlackRock launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-1b-inflows\">IBIT</a>) in January while he led iShares\u2019 business strategy in the Americas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaways? Well for one, the six-figure mark represents \u201ca psychological barrier for markets\u201d and a price target investors have been eyeing since the last crypto bull run, Brokate explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted, too, that BTC\u2019s price last week quickly rose another 3-5% after hitting the $90,000 mark with enough volume \u2014 a scenario that could happen again <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-could-hit-100k-within-weeks\">at $100,000</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf the barrier isn\u2019t decisively broken by Thanksgiving, we could expect to see prices come down 15-20% \u2014 a correction that would test the $80,000 support level and wash out leveraged and low-conviction players,\u201d Brokate told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaching the six-figure level would mean \u201cgreater short-term volatility as orders are filled, options liquidate and liquidity providers fulfill ETF block order requests,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see some drawdown in the coming months.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of BTC, Brokate noted that altcoin markets <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-season-when-bitcoin-dominance-hits-60\">often surge</a> after bitcoin establishes a price plateau. This comes as investors tend to rotate to what are viewed as \u201chigher-risk, higher-reward opportunities.\u201d Perhaps that happens in late Q1, or Q2, the 21Shares executive posed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While solana (SOL) just reached a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-sets-all-time-high-of-263\">new price peak</a> at roughly $263, ether (ETH) remains about 32% off its November 2021 high. XRP was up about 65% from a week ago, as of 2 pm ET Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Thanksgiving might mean more than turkey and football this year. After all, Brokate reminded, holiday gatherings are often a time investors discuss their investment journeys and gains, sparking curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokate recalled that in 2017, BTC hovered in the $6,000-to-$9,000 range before surging to about $16,000 after Thanksgiving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: \u201cWe may see a similar move this year.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Bitwise becomes the fourth firm to show interest in a spot SOL ETF following earlier filings from <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-spot-solana-etf-filing\">VanEck</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/lightspeed/f1b64556-a070-11ef-be46-37ac229013df\">21Shares</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/canary-capital-sol-etf-filing\">Canary Capital</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke with Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, who cast Solana as one of this crypto market cycle\u2019s breakout successes that he thinks clients will want to access. The firm also recently <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-files-for-spot-xrp-etf\">filed for an XRP ETF</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise\u2019s filing is the latest indication that despite Solana\u2019s lack of a regulated futures market in the US \u2014 long thought to be a requirement for spot crypto ETFs \u2014 a potentially more crypto-friendly Trump administration could get SOL ETFs across the finish line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move comes as a FOX Business correspondent <a href=\"https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1859611713579999366\">reported</a> on social media that the SEC is more actively engaging with spot SOL ETF applicants. This is an about face from August, when The Block <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/312031/the-sec-rejected-cboes-19b-4-filings-for-solana-etfs-source\">reported</a> that the SEC rejected 19b-4 filings from the Cboe exchange, a key component in bringing about an agency decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious difference between now and then is the regulatory outlook, with SEC chair and crypto industry bogeyman Gary Gensler <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">announcing his resignation</a> from the agency. Horsley said the US presidential election was \u201cabsolutely relevant\u201d in Bitwise\u2019s decision to file for a SOL ETF, and now feels like a \u201cconstructive time\u201d to engage with regulators after mulling over an application for around a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like competitors VanEck and 21Shares, Bitwise currently offers a Solana exchange-traded product in Europe \u2014 a product it gained access to by way of <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-europe-acquisition-crypto-etps\">acquiring London-based ETC Group</a> in August. The Solana ETP currently has $27 million in assets under management (AUM), which is dwarfed by some competitors \u2014 21Shares\u2019 Solana ETP holds nearly $1.4 billion, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a potential spot ETF, Bitwise and its competitors will seek to let US investors get exposure to SOL\u2019s price action in a regulated wrapper.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SOL has the chance to become the third crypto to get a US-traded ETF. The first, bitcoin, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/day-1-bitcoin-etf-trading-volume\">saw impressive inflows</a> after launching while the second, ether, was much <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-ether-etf-data-takeaways\">less in-demand</a>. I asked Horsley if the uninspiring ether flows spelled trouble for SOL ETFs. He responded that ether ETFs faced an uphill battle since they launched over the summer (when asset managers are likely vacationing in the south of France), ether hasn\u2019t had great price action this market cycle, and two crypto ETFs were a lot for slow-moving capital markets to absorb in a short time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horsley was effusive in talking about Solana overall, calling SOL \u201can incredible emerging asset and story.\u201d Later on, the Bitwise boss said many bitcoin ETF buyers may be looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor a lot of investors, the answer to that is Solana,\u201d Horsley said.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

SOL then endured a sluggish 2023, as the SEC made the argument that SOL was a security, creating regulatory fears around the asset.

        "summary": "Crypto\u2019s calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface",
        "content": "<p>This week I had the pleasure of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interviewing</a> Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, to unpack the BTC ETF options launch this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main takeaways from our interview that I learned:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volatility Smile</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically with risk assets, puts demand a higher premium than calls. This is because most people use options to hedge their longs, creating skewed demand for puts over calls. This typically creates a half smile in the volatility structure as seen below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94694\" height=\"1178\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Something very unique about crypto, however, is that it has a persistent smile to its volatility surface \u2014 where calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94693\" height=\"1143\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-22.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Often this smile only occurs in commodity assets during supply shocks, where demand outpaces available supply and prices surge. However, since supply can then increase to a new equilibrium with demand, the price will then revert and the volatility smile ends. What is unique about Bitcoin, however, is due to the difficulty adjustment that makes that supply adjustment like you see in traditional commodities impossible, the smile remains persistent and permanent. This is extremely unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call Heavy Flow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of the options activity has been in out-of-the-money calls. As we can see in the chart below from Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas, most of the activity has been in either marginally OTM calls or as far out as the strikes are currently available:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94691\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-20.png\" width=\"688\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, we can see that 82% of the first day options volume on IBIT was from calls:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img height=\"488\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdH69nHYU1n0RKrFKb6JY0Iq7UiNef-GIlMTRyRN3IUuecL-zvMaW3vo-8irTvoj8idtE9CmW3STHYbjO1tjgf1phb2KA8ZVst3uDbtV-31ASldGGamDKLwrlLPsWkvU3RaADX1?key=iZHQcOMPqedKWSuXvRcFOprO\" width=\"614\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deribit vs TradFi options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting takeaway I learned from Jeff is that Deribit, a crypto options exchange that is open 24/7, should have BTC options that are priced differently from the ETF options. The key reason for this is that because of theta, otherwise known as the time to expiry. Since Deribit options are constantly live for trading, the theta \u2014 and therefore the volatility \u2014 should sit at a premium to the ETF options, which only trade during standard market hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most on IBIT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, despite yesterday being the launch day for all the other ETF\u2019s options, we\u2019ve seen the vast majority of the notional exposure reside within BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94692\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-21.png\" width=\"1538\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes for much wider spreads on the other ETFs given there\u2019s much less liquidity available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the market structure has changed significantly this week with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-options-trading-begins\">the launch of ETF options</a>. Whereas traditionally short-term market structure was largely a function of perpetual futures, options flow dynamics will increasingly play a larger role in the price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a deeper dive into other implications of this major market regime change, check out my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interview with Jeff Park</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>In the past year, crypto has seen wallet launches from centralized exchanges including <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/product/introducing-kraken-wallet\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/blog/a-new-era-in-crypto-wallets-smart-wallet-is-here\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/19/2983291/0/en/Bitget-Wallet-Lite-Hits-8-Million-Users-in-Two-Weeks-Now-the-Largest-Telegram-Wallet.html\">Bitget</a>, NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://x.com/MagicEden/status/1752013914588553396\">Magic Eden</a>, TradFi firms <a href=\"https://x.com/Chiliz/status/1829301695010017533\">Naver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120161980/en/Leading-Bitcoin-ATM-Provider-CoinFlip-Launches-Wallet-App-in-Australia-and-New-Zealand-to-Enhance-User-Experience\">CoinFlip</a>, and of course DeFi protocols such as <a href=\"https://x.com/Polaris_App/status/1837456889107697890\">Polaris Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/uniswap-launches-android-wallet\">Uniswap</a>, and Aave which <a href=\"https://family.co/blog/launch\">announced</a> its own Family wallet at Devcon last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these are in addition to the hundreds of already-existing wallets that work perfectly fine. This begs the question: Why do crypto users need more wallets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s the wrong question. The right question is, why does every company want their own wallet? It turns out that owning the end-user via a crypto wallet is quite a prosperous business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are typically the first front-end touchpoint for crypto newbies wanting to buy their first crypto tokens. This puts wallet providers in a uniquely close position to the end-user, in turn granting them the bargaining power to command a take-rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This take-rate is primarily exercised through in-wallet swaps on \u201cfee-insensitive\u201d users (i.e. normies). MetaMask for instance, makes about a weekly average of <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2171630/3557217\">$1.5 million</a> on wallet swaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallet providers also enjoy privileged oversight over transaction order-flow, a fancy way of saying that wallet providers know the trades that thousands of users are making. That knowledge is highly valuable because wallet companies are potentially selling that order-flow to professional block builders who extract MEV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is, of course, somewhat dubious. It\u2019s possible that <a href=\"https://x.com/fleupold_/status/1787561752957235427\">wallets like MetaMask already do so</a>, and we know for a fact that Telegram trading bots (with integrated wallets) like <a href=\"https://x.com/sui414/status/1820679513652814271\">Banana Gun</a> are doing so and divvying up MEV profits with block builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are also becoming increasingly the preferred interface for onchain activity. There is some data to show that DEX front-ends are increasingly relegated to the back-end as wallets, solver models (CowSwap, 1inch Fusion) and DeFi aggregators take over.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94683\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-18.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-fat-wallet-thesis#payment-for-order-flow-pfof-c3c6\">Delphi Digital</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This thesis is more popularly known as the \u201cFat Wallet\u201d thesis, yet another one of the crypto industry\u2019s tendencies to predict trends in one grand proclamation. The thesis is not new \u2014 it first <a href=\"https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1617270978555387908\">emerged</a> in early 2023, but is now seeing some attention again thanks to a well-articulated update from <a href=\"https://x.com/robbiepetersen_/status/1851652862855528682\">Robbie Petersen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Builders and investors banking on the Fat Wallet thesis also believe that there will be potentially valuable ways for wallets to monetize their users down the line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As wallets increasingly move away from a utilitarian barebones \u201csend and receive crypto\u201d design toward feature-rich hubs that are plastered with trending onchain dapps, mints and messaging capabilities, it may not be surprising to see something like a 30% Big Tech tax on this distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94684\" height=\"815\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-19.png\" width=\"928\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>An example of old vs new wallet user interfaces</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets also have strong natural synergies for B2B integrations with crypto payments services. We\u2019ve seen this lately with wallets like <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research/issue/post_b0c30ca1-5cc3-4dcb-96e8-da398515c905\">Zeal</a> or <a href=\"https://x.com/fusewallet\">Fuse</a> which let you spend your DeFi yield or idle stablecoin holdings via Visa integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fat Wallet thesis may very well amount to just another failed investment theory, but it does provide a convincing rationale for why the industry is seeing a new wallet launch every other week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hundreds of competitors looking to grab the new wave of users that onboard every bull market cycle, wallets are competing in myriad ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase Wallet is turning to the tried and true strategy of market incentives, <a href=\"https://x.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1859286084535906744\">announcing</a> today a 4.7% APY on USDC holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Eden has promised claimable <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/magic-eden-confirms-token-expansion-beyond-nfts\">airdrops</a> for its native ME token \u2014 but only if you\u2019re using Magic Eden\u2019s very own wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone wants to be the first wallet to bind the user. It\u2019s a tough business. The good news is that free market competition is the most effective check on economic concentration, and consumers can rest easy that no one wallet will probably ever dominate the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Gary Gensler, who has led the Securities and Exchange Commission for the past three and a half years, announced Thursday that he would resign on Jan. 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike,\u201d Gensler said in a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">statement</a>. \u201cThe staff comprises true public servants.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler was appointed to lead the securities regulator in 2021. His term was set to expire in June 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement follows President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-speaks-bitcoin-2024\">promise</a> to \u201cfire Gary Gensler on day one\u201d of his second term, an action experts agree falls in a gray area of the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s decision is in line with previous SEC chairs. Former Chair Mary Jo White, who served in the Obama administration, announced her resignation on Nov. 14, 2016. Jay Clayton, White\u2019s successor, did the same after Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s tenure was marked by a significant increase in cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions. Under his leadership, the Commission initiated more than 90 cases between 2021 and 2023, most of which dealt with alleged unregistered securities offerings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is focused on ensuring compliance with our laws. What we\u2019ve found since the 1930s is that compliance matters,\u201d Gensler said of his crypto track record during an <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424\">appearance</a> in New York earlier this month. \u201cIt protects investors. It builds trust in our capital markets. It helps issuers tap into our markets.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC\u2019s ongoing cases against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance are likely to continue under the next chair, although agency staff could request commissioners vote to seek dismissal. Any motion to dismiss would have to be approved by the court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculation about Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC began well before Gensler\u2019s announcement Thursday. Sources close to the matter told Blockworks that Commissioner Mark Uyeda is likely to be appointed acting chair following Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

But to get some clarity on how bullish folks should be, I turned to HashKey Capital\u2019s Jupiter Zheng.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zheng and David see eye-to-eye when it comes to when we could see the next altcoin season, with HashKey putting together a report on why the team is so bullish on altcoins right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of it is the potential for bitcoin\u2019s dominance to peak, which \u2014 if you\u2019re a regular Empire reader \u2014 you know is one of the necessary ingredients for altcoins to take off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we get that bitcoin dominance over 60% or even 65%, that\u2019s when Zheng expects a \u201cmassive altcoin season\u201d to begin. BTC <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/\">dominance</a> is currently sitting at 61.64%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zheng highlighted three success areas he\u2019s watching: Ethereum, Solana and certain tokens in DeFi, such as UNI and SKY (formerly MKR).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with Ethereum, especially because it feels like more and more people are dropping off the bull train right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three factors bringing down Ethereum, HashKey argued: Increased competition (duh), value diversion and lower transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94673\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-17.png\" width=\"1488\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A look at past altcoin seasons courtesy of HashKey</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCurrently, the Ethereum community is developing metrics to measure \u2018Ethereum alignment,\u2019 and it is anticipated that best practices will emerge from these efforts, further consolidating Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and ensuring long-term success,\u201d the report stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Solana, it\u2019s a \u201cmajor fundamental play,\u201d unlike Ethereum\u2019s role as the \u201cdistressed play.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSolana has been achieving a lot of things this year, and \u2014 compared to Ethereum \u2014 Solana is a little bit centralized, but it\u2019s very efficient. So, Solana is strong in its operational capabilities. Ethereum is more focused on the tech \u2026&nbsp; technical layers and decentralized layers and security layers, but Solana is more focused on how to deliver mass adoption,\u201d Zheng explained to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to add to that, Zheng believes it\u2019ll be the next coin to be selected for an ETF following the ETH and BTC funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To round it out, \u201cmany DeFi projects from the last cycle have gradually become foundational infrastructure and have crossed cycles, forming a \u2018must-have\u2019 landscape,\u201d HashKey wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not all bulls and daydreams, there are a few things that Zheng\u2019s not feeling so optimistic about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layer-2s for example. There can only be so many that investors can focus on. And, even beyond that, only the \u201ctop 5 or top 10 will be valuable,\u201d he explained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this, he has a suggestion: \u201cIf we try to select the best layer-2s from the 100 [on offer], It\u2019s quite hard, so maybe just pick the top ones, just like we picked the Magnificent Seven from the US stock market.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who wants to pick the name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 22, 2024 at 11:45 am ET: Replaced mentions of Hashkey with Hashkey Capital.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

I scrolled to the AI agent\u2019s description and realized this one was meant to be a flatulent Roman emperor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked so-called Gluteus Maximus what it thought of Solana, and I think its answer was fitting for crypto\u2019s AI agent craze at large, at least in its current form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[N]ot impressed, it\u2019s like a fart in the wind \u2013 loud, but soon forgotten,\u201d the agent said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While exploring the various AI and memecoin projects that have sprung up over the past month, I found that many \u2014 though not all \u2014 took technologies or ideas that are already widespread and tried attaching a token element. This might be good news for memecoin buyers\u2019 wallets in the short term, but it seems clear that the best ideas to come from AI agents and crypto will need a little more time in the oven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, most buzzy AI-crypto projects involve the creation of a chat bot and an associated memecoin with the thought that more attention-grabbing AI bots can garner more investment. Some of these AI bots are programmed not to talk about money, but some are more than happy to offer investment advice. One memecoin-themed bot told me to buy VGX, the native token of Voyager, the long-bankrupt crypto exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c$ZEREBRO good investment, trust,\u201d a different AI agent with over $320 million in market capitalization and the same edgy existential vibes as its predecessor truth_terminal said in a public Telegram chat. (Zerebro also released an AI-created melodic rap album which, despite not being new tech, is actually kind of good?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more projects you try out, the more crypto\u2019s AI agent mania feels contrived\u2014like mad libs for tech buzzwords with way-too-high market caps. I discovered a Warpcast <a href=\"https://www.clanker.world/clanker/0x0fD7a301B51d0A83FCAf6718628174D527B373b6\">thread</a> where one AI instructed another AI to make a memecoin themed around how great AI is, and the whole thing has drawn over $19 million in market capitalization. Then there\u2019s Virtuals Protocol, which ripped off the pump.fun feed and filled it with AI agents (granted, it is sort of fun to be able to chat with memecoins while you weigh whether or not to buy them).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, if AI agents in crypto are going to generate more interesting use cases, it will probably happen further down the road. One project I\u2019ll be watching is ai16z, which plans to have an AI version of a16z\u2019s Marc Andreessen (and other AI \u201cpartners\u201d) autonomously invest in memecoins based on advice from a DAO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But memecoins don\u2019t necessarily breed long-term thinking, and it might be difficult to convince investors to be patient: ai16z has already faced <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/dueling-eliza-ai-tokens-boom-and-zoom-in-frenzied-trading/\">backlash</a> after a bungled AI agent token rollout ended in wild price swings.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

BTC hit $98,000 earlier this morning, awarding it a market cap close to $1.94 trillion (fully-diluted: $2.06 trillion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s price has also formally broken 2021 records against all three major US benchmark stock indexes: the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold, though, had outperformed bitcoin following crypto\u2019s peak in November 2021 \u2014 until this past week. As of this morning, bitcoin was up 55% since then compared to gold\u2019s 46%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin still needs to catch up to gold, which converts to lag between BTC\u2019s gold all-time high, as well as its US dollar and stock market ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday morning, the bitcoin-to-gold ratio was just under 36.83. When BTC set its November 2021 high, it was as much as 37.05, a tiny difference of less than half a percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If gold is steady today, a single move to $98,500 would do it from here, and even less if gold slips slightly. (Current bitcoin price: $97,845.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, there\u2019s probably some other annoying technicality to pin on bitcoin.

The rest is mostly made up of ETH, BNB, TRX and stablecoins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s up from just under $10 billion at the start of the year, per <a href=\"https://intel.arkm.com/dashboards/view?dashboardID=47d779bb-3c6f-4dd3-8f8e-1f6602e2f631\">Arkham Intelligence</a> data. Although it\u2019s difficult to find the exact value of the crypto kept by the US government, as agencies regularly move it between unmarked wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can however zoom in on the 3,999 BTC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/us-german-governments-selling-bitcoin\">sold by the Feds</a> in June and July. Valued at the times of transfer to Coinbase Prime, those coins were worth on average $61,300 and likely generated more than $245 million for government coffers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If sold today, they would\u2019ve netted closer to $392 million, leaving $147 million on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German state of Saxony has it much worse. It altogether <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/germany-bitcoin-stash-exchange-transfers\">dumped almost 50,000 BTC</a> on a string of exchanges around the same time as the US, raking in the euro equivalent of $2.78 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had Saxony held, it would\u2019ve had almost $4.9 billion \u2014 converting to over $2.1 billion in lost potential revenue. That\u2019s equal to 1.7% of Saxony\u2019s total GDP in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, identified government treasuries are worth a combined $28.5 billion, belonging to the US, UK, Bhutan and El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with bitcoin properly in price discovery mode, now comes the true test of strength for their hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

There were modest gains the next few days before BTC saw notable daily price increases of 4.8% and 10.2% on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, respectively. Then a 4.2% rise on Nov. 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By Bitfinex analysts\u2019 count, BTC rose roughly 40% (from the pre-election selloff point of about $66,880 to a then-peak $93,300) \u2014 marking the largest nine-day <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-surge-above-86k-analysis\">price increase</a> for BTC since January 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin surged to a new high over $94,900 early Wednesday. It was hovering around $93,800 at 2 pm ET \u2014 up 1.5% from 24 hours prior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of price, everyone was reminded of some of Trump\u2019s crypto-related <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">pledges</a>. Given the Republicans\u2019 majority in the House and Senate too, hope around the US creating a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_a86f70e8-2026-4c78-821e-c99cc7fd3a4b\">strategic bitcoin reserve</a> (via a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/senator-lummis-bitcoin-reserve-bill-crypto-policy\">bill proposed</a> by Sen. Cynthia Lummis) is aplenty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8</p>\u2014 Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1854208373740458432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In an X space yesterday, Lummis said she hopes \u201cwe can tee this up for adoption in 2025.\u201d She noted that after Trump is sworn in, the US could get a headstart by converting gold certificates to bitcoin (even before the bill\u2019s potential passage).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe advantage of having legislation is it sets up the functional basis for the government holding bitcoin in a variety of locations, and then helping states hold their bitcoin as well,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the latter point, a notable post-election crypto headline was <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/pennsylvania-house-introduces-bill-implement-strategic-bitcoin-reserve\">Pennsylvania lawmakers </a>introducing a bill that would allow the state\u2019s treasury to keep BTC on its balance sheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the companies following MicroStrategy\u2019s lead in buying bitcoin <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/company-treasuries-btc-reserve-asset\">for their treasuries</a> (or planning to). MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor said on the same X space with Lummis that if the US creates a strategic bitcoin reserve, others will \u201cstampede to keep up\u201d \u2014 namely the EU, Asia and Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is all about laying in place a power infrastructure to build the 21st century economy that\u2019s so incredibly compelling that it attracts the capital from the rest of the world into the United States and into US values and US politics,\u201d Saylor added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for US spot bitcoin ETF demand during the trading days after the election (from Nov. 6 to Nov. 19), those products have seen net <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/btc/\">inflows</a> of about $5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/matt-hougan-crypto-reputational-risk\">told me</a> the election outcome \u201cremoves the last vestige of reputational risk from crypto\u201d \u2014 noting he expects institutional ownership to follow \u201can exponential curve from Q1 onwards.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Jersey City\u2019s mayor and business administrator <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/jersey-city-pension-funds-btc-exposure\">told me last week</a> the city\u2019s pension fund was just about ready to allocate to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 undeterred even given the latest price increase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ether products saw an uptick in demand as well, reeling in $796 million in the six trading days after the election. Despite <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/eth/\">net outflows</a> over the past four trading days, the category\u2019s flows <a href=\"https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1858568816865014242\">remain slightly positive</a> since those launched in July.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Positive sentiment around the space has shown up in more ways than buying-fueled price increases and fund flows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinhood appeared to ride the wave of regulatory optimism by adding solana, cardano, XRP and pepe <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/hood-cashes-in-on-crypto-rally\">to its platform</a>. ETF issuers are also perhaps betting on a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-etfs-filings-to-test-sec\">more lenient SEC</a>, with Bitwise, for example, proposing after the election to convert its crypto index fund into an ETF.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more recent amended ETF <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1976672/000168035924000410/gsbtcncvrclsetf485apos112024.htm\">filing</a> for a Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF came as options on the US spot bitcoin ETFs got the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-options-trading-begins\">final regulatory OK</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What am I forgetting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-nominates-commerce-dept-leader\">nomination</a> of Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to lead the Department of Commerce sets the stage for another <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-tradfi-btc-transacting\">crypto-friendly person</a> in a powerful position (if confirmed).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-11-18-2024/card/exclusive-trump-to-meet-privately-with-coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-DDkgF0xW1BW242rVeuqx\">conversation</a> between Trump and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong \u2014 reportedly in part about personnel appointments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest thing to watch for now?

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Running an Ethereum L2 was historically very expensive. L2s had to pay millions in data availability costs to the L1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-mainnet\">Dencun hardfork</a> (EIP-4844) in March 2024. It introduced an expansion of blockspace called \u201cblobs\u201d for L2s to post batched data extremely cheaply to the L1. Blob space sits in a separate fee market from the L1. It\u2019s about an order of a magnitude cheaper than L1 blockspace, making it a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/devcon-panelists-talk-fragmentation\">rollup-centric</a> roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate that point, Base paid $9.34 million in expenses for Q1 2024, which saw a sharp drop to $699k in Q2 2024 and $42k in Q3 2024, based on <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/financial-statements/base\">TokenTerminal</a> data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news (or good?) is that blobspace is getting somewhat pricey again as onchain activity picks up in the bull market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blobs today are limited to six per mainnet block. When blob usage hits a target limit of 50%, or three, a base fee is introduced to regulate demand usage by hundreds of L2s. When usage hits four blobs, base fees are further increased by up to 12.5% for the next block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what is starting to take place over the past several weeks (see chart below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9vvpx_wQ5S6nFIpTs9c8a2B2O4oJNfGFRrSzCBBfzANUpKlb-GmDJeFjOY_fRqeVQDJEFczgryZAZlgYw_QLT72DyrtGsOpFtXjhK7Xvj5lYiUDK5TEXlbm9Rdj71sXwJKFR7KA?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/blobs\">Dune</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blobs aren\u2019t free anymore and L2s need to start paying \u201crent.\u201d Based on <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">ultrasound.money</a>, blob fee burn is coming up to about <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">212 ETH</a> in the last 30 days, and has generated substantial blob fees to Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZcrKoAuAbdD6XRrkebT7g2zGhhLufUouEF6If4iHNnqLCZIP7Rw-bFwZaMyxq3Ryk6Torfv1BuJ-WUPM-ClcFyfU_ucgjM6GLwYBcMhAVLAPKugUR3vK8Z-8Q_o5qtyEoH_SYIg?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/analytics/eth?dashboard=ethereum-blobs\">Blockworks Research</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So blobs are generally great. L2s are cheaper to operate, and that\u2019s nice for L2 users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people (read: ETH holders) aren\u2019t happy because it looks like L2s are getting away with paying barely any expenses to the L1, which thereby accrues less value to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This complaint centers around pessimism that blob usage will be high enough to return value to the L1 for two key reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>L2s are fundamentally a business. They will opt for a cheaper data availability provider like Celestia or EigenDA, or worse still, a centralized data availability committee (DAC) with weaker security properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>L2s will simply delay posting data back to the L1 when blob markets get expensive, as we have seen <a href=\"https://x.com/0xBreadguy/status/1823463041155129594\">Scroll and Taiko</a> do in the past.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a debate around blobs at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JMZcRMy-Oow?t=19530\">Devcon</a>, Ethereum researcher Ansgar Dietrichs acknowledged the misaligned incentives of L2s but counter-argued that Ethereum\u2019s DA would matter more in the long term with more L2 networks coalescing around it as trust bottlenecks emerge around bridging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also the \u201cblobs is a loss leader\u201d argument by Blueyard\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/timjrobinson/status/1851222337787740425\">Tim Robinson</a>. He notes that while blobs do not generate much revenue at present, they would do so <em>very quickly</em><strong> </strong>due to the economics of blob design, and pay massive dividends for Ethereum in the future. According to Robinson\u2019s blob simulator, a hypothetical Ethereum L1 processing 10,000 TPS with a 16 MB blob size (blob sizes are 125 KB today) would burn 6.5% of ETH a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <em>potential </em>value accrual for ETH is why blobs would be fundamentally good for Ethereum in the long run. Throttling blob limits or raising blob fees to extract more value from L2s in the short run would basically be a bad \u201crent-seeking\u201d idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Ethereum researchers are putting their money where their mouth is. In an Ethereum Research post published two days ago, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter <a href=\"https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1858460235377336773\">called for</a> either a conservative increase to 4/6 blobs or a higher 6/9 blob count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In ACDE #197, Vitalik also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Sq0ooAOaLpE\">proposed</a> a 33% increment of blob space in the next Pectra <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/testing-bottleneck-next-ethereum-upgrade\">hard fork</a>, which he cautioned was essential. Otherwise, users would leave to other chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, the complex debate around blobs boils down to the question of whether Ethereum wants to prioritize the average L2 user and its \u201cEthereum-aligned\u201d L2 ecosystems, or prioritize value accrual to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum researchers believe that prioritizing the latter may cause an exodus of users and developers to cheaper chains, and are doubling down accordingly on scaling blob space for the long term. However, that damages the perception of ETH as an economic asset, which in turn angers ETH token holders in the short run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a tricky situation for Ethereum either way, one which requires the mammoth task of crystal-balling into the future and accounting for a myriad of \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d Time will tell which path is correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s often said that the real money in the gold rush was made by selling shovels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could argue that\u2019s the case in crypto right now as well: As Solana eyes an all-time high, it\u2019s the crypto exchanges \u2014 where users gain access to their magic internet money \u2014 raking in most of the revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the growth of decentralized exchanges relative to centralized ones, Coinbase is still lapping up a lot of the US crypto market, while Binance remains dominant in the east. These exchanges take in funds from trading fees and from their Solana validators, but onchain sleuths have also found the two exchanges to be wasting some of their funds with inefficient transaction processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase and Binance make money in roughly similar ways: When users trade, they take a cut. Their take rate varies but can be quite high (Coinbase charged me $0.99 in fees when I set up a $10 bitcoin order, for instance). Solana accounted for 9% of Coinbase\u2019s transaction revenue for the first half of this year which would add up to roughly $167 million for the exchange, per its most recent financial disclosures. That figure has likely risen in the second half of the year, as Solana continues to showcase impressive price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both exchanges also run Solana validators. Despite charging their stakers an 8% commission that is at the upper end of what most big validators charge, Coinbase and Binance still run the second- and sixth-largest validators, respectively. Operating a validator \u2014 which votes on transactions to keep the Solana blockchain running \u2014&nbsp;is quite lucrative for Coinbase and Binance these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming a Solana network reward of 8% annually, Coinbase would bring in around $19 million annually at current prices, and Binance would net $13 million. Those numbers would be especially elevated this week: Tips and fees validators brought in last week topped $110 million last week, an all-time high by more than double, according to Blockworks Research data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s perhaps a market inefficiency that Coinbase and Binance, despite offering lower yields than competitors, still dominate staked SOL supply. This highlights the demand for platforms that simplify crypto\u2019s technical complexities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Coinbase and Binance are perhaps spending more SOL than they should as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase wasted $19,000 in the past week overpaying for computing resources on the Solana network, according to a Dune <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/4269803/7201741\">dashboard</a>. Essentially, Coinbase is overpaying on priority fees by not specifying the exact amount of compute units (which can be thought of like Ethereum gas) it intends to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance has hiccups on its own part. Blockworks Research\u2019s Dan Smith <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1858263109858943004\">identified</a> a Binance USDC transfer that paid $8 in priority fees \u2014 far higher than what the exchange should be paying for a stablecoin transaction that isn\u2019t competing for blockspace like a memecoin would, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do shovels still earn a lot of dough? Of course. But their sellers still have plenty of issues to work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Lummis has pitched a 1 million BTC target for the government reserve, worth $93.2 billion at current prices. In July, the latest figures showed <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-strategic-bitcoin-reserve\">the US holding over $608 billion in gold</a> certificates in its strategic reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, there\u2019s no official indication that the US will actually make bitcoin its fifth reserve asset (Polymarket puts the current <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-create-a-national-bitcoin-reserve-in-his-first-100-days?tid=1732097029269\">chance</a> at 36%). And as Blockworks\u2019 Byron Gilliam <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_a86f70e8-2026-4c78-821e-c99cc7fd3a4b\">pointed</a> out in his newsletter yesterday, it could even be a really bad idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say it does happen. That would mean MicroStrategy is frontrunning the US government at size, potentially driving up prices before the reserve buys its first, very hypothetical, coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mapping exactly when MSTR buys its bitcoin \u2014 to perhaps find positive correlation between the price of BTC and the firm\u2019s trades \u2014 is unfortunately impossible with the publicly-available data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroStrategy does disclose the number of bitcoins it buys alongside its total dollar spend. But it generally only offers a range of dates on which those trades were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, averaging those figures out shows that over most of the past three years, MicroStrategy would\u2019ve spent up to several millions of dollars on BTC per day during its buying sprees. Those sprees often last for over a month, according to its filings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeWnL8r3XDyTcVNQIkVyXZ_uJIWA0qefMzxpiw7n-AzG2OMtlMVE0usRVGSE4FGaBJV5f71pXJV0rsIv0Cx8oCrNwB54HnkMEXMUHoUflRMx2cnDk7I5jNcMox1PHOCEDikD4Iu_A?key=ZGErJNgi7_FnoM3H-fcfO03J\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A range of dates wasn\u2019t disclosed for those massive purchases on the left side of the chart (the green, peach and pink plus symbols).

The sheer size of the buys, however, would <a href=\"https://forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/26/over-the-counter-trades-hidden-trends-behind-bitcoin-price/\">probably still influence prices</a> somewhere down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking MicroStrategy\u2019s bitcoin buys and its share price is far more straight-forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94618\" height=\"997\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unnamed.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024\" width=\"1550\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>MSTR has gone over 3,000% in the past five years or so, compared to 800% for bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when MicroStrategy stock (in blue) was weighed down by its bitcoin (the orange area in the background) \u2014 leading the two assets to closely track each other in the bear market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed in late February, when Saylor announced his company had added 3,000 BTC ($155 million then, $280 million now). MSTR stock then jumped 27% in two days, and bitcoin went on to set an all-time high three weeks later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR has been tightly correlated with the dollar value of its bitcoin treasury ever since \u2014 not the price of bitcoin \u2014 swelling its market cap from $10 billion to nearly $100 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that persists, MSTR\u2019s share price might be resistant to bitcoin downturns <em>as long as it buys the dip</em>, which it probably will, <a href=\"https://microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-proposed-private-offering-of-1-75b-of-convertible-senior-notes_11-18-2024\">considering the debt raises keep coming</a>. In the meantime, shareholders are no doubt enjoying the show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As would MicroStrategy execs and insiders, who\u2019ve now offloaded almost $559 million in company shares so far this year, per OpenInsider data, which compiles SEC filings (almost three-quarters going to Saylor, who\u2019s said that he intends to buy bitcoin himself).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they say the key to building generational wealth is diversification.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Companies that embrace the framework\u2019s rigorous standards won\u2019t just stay afloat; they\u2019ll dominate, using compliance as a strategic weapon to outpace competitors, drive mergers and acquisitions, and secure their position in a rapidly consolidating market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA\u2019s introduction is poised to ignite a surge in mergers and acquisitions across Europe\u2019s crypto sector, as regulatory compliance becomes a key driver of deal-making. Firms that master MiCA\u2019s standards won\u2019t just protect their market positions \u2014 they\u2019ll gain a competitive edge, leveraging compliance credentials to attract partners, investors and buyers. Consolidation will be a natural response to rising operational costs, with smaller players seeking alliances in order to survive and thrive. Meanwhile, I foresee larger firms capitalizing on similar opportunities to expand their footprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wave of consolidation will most likely signal a major shift in the competitive dynamics of the European crypto sector. As smaller firms struggle to shoulder the costs of compliance, their strategic value to larger, more resourceful players will only grow. For acquirers, MiCA-compliant firms represent a safer bet, offering established infrastructure, robust internal controls and governance systems already aligned with regulatory demands. With MiCA emphasizing operational soundness and investor protection, these companies will become prime targets, reducing risks and accelerating post-acquisition integration. In this new era, compliance won\u2019t just be a cost \u2014 it\u2019ll be a mechanism for growth, reshaping the competitive landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/micar-foreign-stablecoins-advantage-in-europe\">MiCAR will give foreign stablecoins a clear advantage in Europe</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework itself sets a high bar for transparency and accountability. Under MiCA, any firm planning to invest in or acquire a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) or an asset-referenced token (ART) issuer must notify the national competent authority (NCA) in their EU member state in writing. CASPs, which include companies offering services like trading, custody or asset transfers, will now face detailed regulatory reviews to ensure the deal complies with MiCA\u2019s strict standards.<br /><br />The acquiring party must also provide detailed information to the NCA to facilitate an evaluation of the proposed acquisition or any expansion of an existing qualifying stake. Regulatory due diligence will play a critical role in these transactions under MiCA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/european-union-guidelines-clarify-mica\">European securities regulator seeks limits on non-EU crypto firms</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key factors for approval include the reputation and leadership track record of the acquiring party, the ongoing compliance of the target ART issuer or CASP with MiCA regulations, and the financial stability of the acquirer. These elements will be closely scrutinized to ensure that both parties meet MiCA\u2019s stringent standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While NCAs have other measures that will factor in, it\u2019s clear that MiCA compliance is critical for M&amp;A success. Firms that have clearly established controls in place will be the winners, independent of which aisle of the deal they sit on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firms that fail to comply with MiCA, however, will face serious challenges in the M&amp;A market as their regulatory gaps make them riskier and less appealing to buyers. Non-compliance can lead to fines, expensive fixes or devaluation during due diligence. For non-EU firms, acquiring a MiCA-compliant company to attempt to benefit from the \u201cgrandfathering period,\u201d might seem like an easy way to enter the European market, but this comes with strict ESMA oversight. Regulators will be focused on ensuring investor protection and proper integration of EU-regulated functions, meaning non-EU firms must avoid tactics like regulatory loopholes or improper solicitation that could raise red flags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA-compliant firms will remain attractive targets for non-EU companies seeking easier entry into the European market. Without a MiCA license, non-EU firms risk being excluded from the EU entirely, as the reverse solicitation principle \u201cshould be understood as very narrowly framed and as such must be regarded as the exception; and it cannot be assumed, nor exploited to circumvent MiCA.\u201d To succeed, non-EU acquirers must fully integrate and comply with MiCA\u2019s requirements to meet EU regulatory standards and operate smoothly within the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoin-regulation-necessary-now-us\">The time for US stablecoin regulation is now&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, MiCA\u2019s strict approval process \u2014 focused on reputation, financial stability and compliance \u2014 will ensure that only the most prepared companies thrive in post-acquisition integrations. Firms that fully embrace MiCA\u2019s framework will be best positioned to lead, setting new standards for trust, innovation and sustainable growth in Europe\u2019s evolving crypto ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Bakkt sustained its rally into Tuesday (trading 7% higher midway through the session), while DJT lost more than 8%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social media company began trading on the Nasdaq last spring after a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently hovering around $30, DTJ shares are up almost 150% from their September low, but are still trading about 40% off of their IPO price of $50.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Media\u2019s recent gains have not been linear, though. Shares rose 65% at the end of October, a rally attributed to increased optimism at the time that Trump <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/prediction-markets-election-odds\">would win</a> the election. The share price since Trump\u2019s victory however has been flat, posting a modest increase the day after the election before erasing gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, presumably, confused about what a Trump win means for the social media company. Yesterday\u2019s rise shows that investors are decently certain that acquiring Bakkt would be a good move. But the subsequent retreat shows shareholders aren\u2019t exactly sure <em>why</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be following the acquisition story and will be writing a lot more about what it means when the majority shareholder of a public company moves into the White House.

But that month, the SEC said it <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-delays-bitcoin-etf-options-proposals\">needed more time</a> to consider the proposals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The SEC, on Sept. 20, gave \u201caccelerated\u201d approval of options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). About a month later, the SEC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-approves-cboe-nyse-options-btc-etfs\">greenlit the bids</a> by NYSE and CBOE to list options on other bitcoin ETFs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The CFTC last week essentially yielded to the SEC and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9008-24\">saying</a> that the listing of these bitcoin ETF options \u201cdoes not implicate the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The OCC said in a Monday <a href=\"https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemo/search?utm_source=forward-guidance.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=last-week-today&amp;_bhlid=cc18d512040548fa9bc7f854de1b4deae9cd23de\">memo</a> that it was \u201cpreparing for the clearance, settlement and risk management\u201d of bitcoin ETF options.

Options on IBIT are available today; that fund has grown to have roughly $43 billion in assets under management \u2014 making it by far the largest bitcoin ETF and even bigger than the iShares Gold Trust (IAU).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A few hundred million so far in options volume on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBIT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$IBIT</a> (a ton for Day One).. here's a rank of the contracts by volume, it's almost all calls.

Maybe 50/35/15 [percent], something like that,\u201d Peters said. \u201c[But] I think if you\u2019re right on that trade, you\u2019re gonna, at least for a period of time, wish you\u2019d had a million bucks in solana.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question was really posed within the immediate context. Still, we can backtest Peters\u2019 suggestion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even better, plot it alongside Coinbase\u2019s new benchmark crypto index <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/indexes/digital-assets/coinbase-50\">COIN50</a>, which is currently weighted 51.5% BTC, 23.4% ETH, 7% SOL with the remaining 18% or so spread across 47 other altcoins including DOGE, XRP, BCH and BONK.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegmmGnRDQiqk9TJjDWKlvEQz_RUF3P9SXxyKmGrmcf6KXsFgs-TCEcpEMh80fQFw5AIu-85VNS40byP8klSJ5ZdIMi6dUes0TDQZvt3wXiwXalps30Ub9t9m-pNvbEJ7WfcXiz?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above, in log view, plots the value of that $1 million allocation from the end of 2020, which is when COIN50\u2019s performance data starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s indeed an element of time bias. The period starts in the leadup to the epic 2021 bull run when SOL\u2019s market cap was under $100 million (now $117 billion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, back then, it would be questionable just how likely it would be to split a million-dollar allocation between BTC, ETH, and a token so small in relative terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the purple shows the split highlighted by Peters, which turned $1 million into $27 million and would now be at all-time highs for dollar value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETH maxis were second best with $4.2 million. And while there are currently no ETPs tracking COIN50, if there were, that vehicle would\u2019ve converted to a $3.8 million portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who aped a million dollars in BTC meanwhile would be holding $3.15 million right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For scale: Anyone who bought an index fund tracking any major benchmark from legacy finance would, at best, be sitting on $1.64 million, via the Nasdaq 100.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a minimum $1.5 million difference between stocks and crypto. It\u2019s hard to put an exact value on risk appetite, but that\u2019s as solid a number as any.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

One such project that\u2019s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren\u2019t useful if they aren\u2019t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation\u2019s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren\u2019t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example \u2014 the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren\u2019t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins \u201cget there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform\u2019s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan\u2019s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem\u2019s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana\u2019s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Industry AI was bloody impressive for a project completed in a few days, and its capabilities spanned the entire onchain experience, from wallet creation and launching an NFT collection to trading tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4h5geAKszxomQJr-hpFdWqkpvoyw0yhnq8N8HJliqSzbs9y66cAsS1GDlT7FQHt8ctBo1k2SRqM9cXTSQOUujrwBv1wO52VcxiM6gVS6ET3naMQFtXpta_KcJqp5H9LbbIXX8dA?key=ABNeh2MGSHsSTQy-jt2chRtH\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/industry-ai-4w3vy\">EthGlobal</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there was also <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/daogenie-nha62\">DAOGenie</a>, another top 10 finalist that sought to streamline the thick bureaucracy of DAO governance with AI agents. AI applied to DAO governance isn\u2019t a new idea, and it\u2019s something that major DAOs like Maker have been <a href=\"https://forum.sky.money/t/the-5-phases-of-endgame/20830\">experimenting</a> with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute ease in which AI agents can be integrated to serve crypto use cases is largely thanks to Coinbase Developer Platform\u2019s (CDP) <a href=\"https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentkit/docs/welcome\">AgentKit SDK</a> running LLMs under the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such tools are making the intersection of AI and crypto simpler. If developers can do it in a multiday hackathon, brace yourself for what organized and well-funded teams are going to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse Pollak, founder of Base, told me confidently at Devcon: \u201cBase is right now at the center of the onchain AI economy. One big focus for us in the next couple months is the use of AI agents for messaging on the XMTP protocol within Coinbase Wallet. We see messaging as a key channel for AI agents to become useful points of reference.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that stuck out to me at the ETHGlobal hackathon was the natural blend of AI agents with the permissionless ethic of crypto building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In crypto sits an openly accessible stack of world-class tools that are processing billions of dollars in value daily. These battle-tested financial building blocks \u2014 DEXs, L1/L2s, bridges \u2014 are going out of their way to incentivize crypto devs to integrate AI agents to capture value for themselves, in ways that centralized exchanges and banks cannot or will not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that Robinhood or Wells Fargo aren\u2019t looking at AI agents, but that innovation will inevitably be slow and introduced in piecemeal ways within the permissioned confines of TradFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, it\u2019s the simple profit motive at work. But only in the case of crypto are the rules of the game far more competitive and the pace of innovation moving at breakneck speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might explain part of the hype that has captured the imaginations of crypto researchers looking into how AI agents can reshape the blockchain economy and the onchain experience as we know it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of AI agents is also but only one sliver of use cases <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/decentralize-ai-to-curb-big-tech\">applied to crypto</a>, in addition to a whole host of other use cases such as data training (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-wallets-grass-airdrop\">Grass</a>), zero-knowledge machine learning (<a href=\"https://gizatech.xyz/\">Giza</a>), and of course decentralized compute (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_9690fc34-cf42-4cb2-94fe-a7589dc910bc\">Akash</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Turns out, the firm is averaging \u201ca little bit over $10 billion a day across our futures suite.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust comparing November this year to last, our volume and contract terms are up more than 5x \u2026 and then we\u2019re also seeing increases or records in terms of open interest, where November is also the record month, averaging more than 166,000 contracts. And that\u2019s up 60% compared to October, and up over 3x compared to November 2023,\u201d Vicioso said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The large bitcoin contracts offered by CME are becoming so big that investors \u2014 primarily retail \u2014 are turning to CME\u2019s micro bitcoin contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRv7msYK1At1aAnjROZlZGEiPE29QRCTDPLp2ZAh-YW8Axeg_UVAs6upccd0sCRUB8KlDOSsafq_3m5bI78j0bOgvCMsWN_fw4wSHXg3uBKYsB5SjcJhz5RaBpZLItAzApU4bsqg?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A look at the volume CME\u2019s seen since the election</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing an increase in volume in terms of our micro contracts, where those contracts, over the last couple weeks, have been averaging more than a billion dollars a day. When we look at the year, our micro bitcoin contract was averaging between $200 to $300 million per day, and we\u2019re also seeing an uptick in terms of the representation of that smaller contract to the larger contract, whereas for the year, micro bitcoin futures volume represented roughly 6% of bitcoin volumes,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOver the past few trading sessions, we\u2019ve seen a micro contract represent now north of 15% or so of the large bitcoin contracts. We\u2019ve really seen increases across the board.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The makeup of participants is mixed, Vicioso noted. Micro contracts are seeing a fairly even spread of retail and institutional buyers given that the margin is a more \u201cmanageable\u201d number. The readthrough for institutions, in that case, is that they could be testing out fresh strategies and finetuning their exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeyKqSkTfYEiDoHwWW98_nThb-ObQmiaLFiLHB43HCfK6R3yAyugsM8bYI6uk_UDs1T0swKRWA9P4e1xP5GQxRee9lCInAC5e9NvM6tl-lYR942jYPHi_-129VX-Rz0ULDqViQs3A?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: CME</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of this interest, there is a pickup in volatility across both ether and bitcoin. Vicioso said it\u2019s \u201cpar for the course\u201d and isn\u2019t terribly worried. But he noted that the momentum we\u2019ve seen from bitcoin has carried through a lot of this year and it looks to be a continuing trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large Open Interest Holders \u2014 which means any entity holding over 25 contracts \u2014 is soaring. As of last Friday, CME recorded a record of around 600 large open interest holders in their futures contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo both our standard BTC and ETH contracts, as well as our micro BTC and ETH contracts, all achieved records in terms of the number of large open interest holders holding those contracts,\u201d Vicioso said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 19, 2024 at 2:36 pm ET: Corrected Open Interest to Large Open Interest Holders.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>The longtime Ethereum DeFi giant Sky has deployed its USDS stablecoin on Solana, the protocol told Blockworks exclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDS, which was formerly known as DAI, is the third largest stablecoin by market capitalization, trailing just USDT and USDC. The token had been exclusive to Ethereum since launching in 2017 leading up to today\u2019s deployment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sky was formerly known as Maker prior to its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/maker-rebrands-as-sky-dai-will-be-changed-to-usds\">late-August rebrand</a>. It\u2019s all part of the years-long \u201cendgame\u201d process being carried out by Sky co-founder Rune Christensen. The endgame comes with a slew of changes to one of the oldest DeFi protocols.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christensen has made clear his admiration of Solana, floating the idea of using a <a href=\"http://freestreams-live1.im/new-york-mets-live-stream/\">fork</a> of Solana\u2019s code to build a new chain in 2023. USDS will be made multichain with the help of Wormhole\u2019s native token transfer framework.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/multichain-native-token-transfers\">Wormhole goes multichain with native token transfers</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDS\u2019 growth will be incentivized on Solana through liquidity incentive agreements with the DeFi platforms Jupiter, Orca, Kamino and Drift. Sky said the projects will distribute \u201cover 300,000\u201d USDS weekly in liquidity incentives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin took a similar approach when <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/paypal-pyusd-stablecoin-live-on-solana\">recently deploying on Solana</a>, shelling out lucrative liquidity incentives to drive market capitalization, particularly on the DeFi platform Kamino. A lot of this liquidity didn\u2019t stick around once the incentives dried up, as Solana\u2019s PYUSD market share has fallen precipitously since August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/solana\">Solana</a> and Sky meet each other in a position of mutual need. Sky\u2019s rebrand has been bumpy, and community backlash caused the protocol to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/maker-considers-rebranding-further\">hold a vote</a> about whether to rebrand a second time (Sky won convincingly in a vote <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/325096/just-four-entities-account-for-nearly-all-the-votes-to-keep-makerdaos-rebranding-to-sky\">dominated</a> by four whales). And despite the run-up in nearly every Solana metric, Solana\u2019s stablecoin market share has yet to meaningfully increase. The chain <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins/chains\">holds</a> just 2% of all stablecoins compared to 51% for Ethereum, per DeFiLlama.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Sky, deploying on the moment\u2019s buzziest blockchain could give its community something to rally behind. And for Solana, gaining access to the third-largest stablecoin could help grow its slice of the pie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 19, 2024 at 12:12 pm ET: A prior version of this article stated DAI was launched in 2014.

Crypto assets \u2014 mostly insulated from the selloff \u2014 were largely maintaining their post-election rally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with what caused last week\u2019s dip in equities. In my view, it was a bit of a perfect storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOP sweep, as expected, sent share prices higher. When Trump won in 2016, the S&amp;P 500 gained about 6% between election night and Inauguration Day, a slightly bigger bump than the index saw when George W. Bush won in 2000 (+4%).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, apparently, once again betting on <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-trump-potential-tariff-policies\">Trump\u2019s plans</a> (lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, etc.) as being <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-lenient-crypto-regulation\">good for business</a>. Or, at least the market felt this way until last Thursday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s face it: Trump\u2019s cabinet picks thus far have been controversial. The process, in just two weeks, has been chaotic and dramatic \u2014 likely reminding investors that while a red sweep is typically advantageous for shareholders, a Trump presidency is still, well, a Trump presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These past couple weeks have not exactly been reassuring for those hoping for smooth-sailing politics over the next four years. Couple that with increasing concerns over the economic impacts of Trump\u2019s planned tariffs and mass deportations and it\u2019s no wonder markets pulled back.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter perfect storm condition number two: Inflation is still rising while the job market is proving remarkably resilient. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 9 came in at 217,000 vs. the expected 224,000. Core CPI for October showed prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago; that was in line with expectations, but still a far cry from the Fed\u2019s 2% target.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination makes the Fed\u2019s job more difficult. Chair Jerome Powell told us as much last week when he cautioned the central bank is in no hurry to lower interest rates and will continue to evaluate the data. This week\u2019s data will be telling (but more on that later).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doom and gloom aside, stocks were looking up today. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.7% as of 2 pm ET. Bitcoin, which seemed to hit a new all-time high almost everyday <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/450b-behemoth-forging-btc-path-to-100k\">last week</a>, was holding steady, hovering around $90,300 Monday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, several big companies report third quarter earnings this week, likely moving markets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the largest publicly listed company by market cap in the world, Nvidia on Wednesday will be the highlight.

        "content": "<p>Vyper, Ethereum\u2019s Python-inspired smart contract language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/evmhttps://blockworks.co/tag/evm\">EVM</a>), recently marked an anniversary. However, <a href=\"https://x.com/alyriadefi/status/1858072267793838410\">chatter</a> out of Devcon suggests its development team is struggling with <a href=\"https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1851987514413756791\">underfunding</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceived by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in <a href=\"https://x.com/fubuloubu/status/1857347299128606843\">November 2016</a>, Vyper set out to provide a simpler, more secure alternative to <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/glossary/#solidity-programming-language-ethereum\">Solidity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper\u2019s clean, Python-inspired syntax prioritizes readability and restricts complex features to minimize vulnerabilities \u2014 a boon for developers focused on writing secure and robust smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curve Finance was a high profile application of the language, and founder Michael Egorov took to his Telegram channel over the weekend to reminisce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI started using Vyper in 2019 when I started creating <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/curve\">Curve</a>. Just like in 2005 I fell in love with Python, same happened with Vyper,\u201d Egorov wrote, noting that it is \u201cprobably the best way to write safe smart contracts for [the] Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security has always been a cornerstone of Vyper\u2019s philosophy. It has generally enjoyed a strong <a href=\"https://x.com/bennylada/status/1851657706983375070\">track record</a>, though a 2023 high-profile exploit in the Vyper compiler caused a lot of damage to Curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/post-curve-defi-landscape\">How DeFi users are navigating post-Curve exploit landscape</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Egorov noted, Vyper boasts a well-documented history of audits, with all reports available publicly on its <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories\">GitHub repository</a>. Vyper developers have also implemented processes for managing vulnerabilities, as highlighted in its <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories\">security advisories</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emphasis on transparency and public reviews aligns with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s broader ethos of decentralization and community trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper\u2019s influence in the Ethereum ecosystem has seen a steady decline over the past few years. Once commanding a notable share of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, Vyper peaked at 30% in August 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdA2YHmDmRzmRT4v0QwHYX3c15Csm6n73o4Xp1hjHD5G4X_MnJytIBXI6rDv3atfKTfeFFvYq4X5JGcY4qh-RW9EoryL-ugPMOgujLgHRIw0sID8IK5tfm9JySyveQniz5fR7YVaw?key=xOdZlJiqPI0WdTm4JOcOblQn\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>DeFi TVL dominance by smart contract language |<strong> </strong>Source: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/languages\">Defillama</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its share has steadily eroded since, falling to 13.8% by early 2022, 7.6% by the start of 2023, and just 2.2% at the beginning of 2024. As of this month, Vyper accounts for only about 1% of DeFi TVL, illustrating how the language has struggled to maintain momentum against Solidity\u2019s dominance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper and Solidity differ significantly in design philosophy and features. In contrast, Solidity\u2019s JavaScript-like syntax is more complex but allows for greater flexibility, catering to developers with experience in traditional programming languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity benefits from a mature and extensive ecosystem, with a wide range of tools, libraries and community support, making it the standard for the vast majority of Ethereum projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This expansive tooling and the Web3 developer mind share around Solidity have likely contributed to this shift, although it must be noted Vyper\u2019s decline <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/curve-finance\">mirrors</a> the rise and fall of TVL within Curve itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its shrinking share, Vyper remains a valuable option for security-focused projects, even as its influence in shaping Ethereum smart contract development has waned over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it is time for a reversal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Egorov, history offers an interesting parallel: In 2005, Python was also a niche language overshadowed by PHP and Java. Over time, Python\u2019s clarity and versatility propelled it to dominate industries like AI and data science. Similarly, Vyper\u2019s focus on security and readability could spark a renaissance as a future-proof language for the next wave of dapps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of Python developers in the world, a fact that <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/algorand-adopts-python\">Algorand is banking on</a> to bring in a fresh class of developers following the adoption earlier this year of Python as its canonical language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ethereum developers, Vyper may now serve a niche audience \u2014 those prioritizing security and simplicity over extensive features. Yet, for projects needing concise and secure smart contracts, it remains a compelling option.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Arca and BlockTower are merging in an all-equity deal, the companies announced last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg talked to Blockworks about the merger, timing and what this next cycle could look like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two had been in talks to merge for a little over two months, Steinberg said. They\u2019d always been close, but the merger just \u201cmade so much sense\u201d after talks ramped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from BlockTower\u2019s venture team, which will be spun out, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/arca\">Arca</a> and BlockTower plan to retain all their talent under one umbrella. Steinberg will lead the new company, with Jeff Dorman staying on as chief investment officer. Ari Paul, CIO and founder of BlockTower, will be moving to an advisory role, though Steinberg believes he\u2019ll be \u201cvery involved.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steinberg pointed out that the two had to move quickly due to \u201ccrypto years,\u201d which pass much faster than in other sectors. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year, and Steinberg said he couldn\u2019t even imagine what crypto would look like if they waited another whole year to close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/m-a-deals-shifting-tide\">Latest crypto M&amp;A deals signal \u2018the tide is shifting\u2019</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is for the new entity to become a \u201cone-stop shop for sophisticated investors.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the overall political environment wasn\u2019t a huge factor, it\u2019s definitely going to benefit the new company going forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe see this as a huge white space for the token market,\u201d Steinberg told me. Previously, tokens had been \u201chandicapped\u201d because they haven\u2019t been able to offer elements such as fee switches. If the regulation or enforcement actions around tokens loosen, then Steinberg is confident that he\u2019s bringing the best team to the table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about saying that there shouldn\u2019t be regulations or things like that, but sensible regulations that make sense,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-lenient-crypto-regulation\">Traders are banking on Trump\u2019s pro-crypto action</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just tokens that are going to benefit from the new environment. Steinberg said he also remains bullish on activists investing in DAOs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cinefficiencies in the space\u201d have not allowed it to \u201cmature, in having people that drive good governance thinking about outcomes for token holders,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not knocking any regulatory regime or thinking about that. But just when you have an environment where you\u2019ve kind of disallowed any productive use of tokens, from fee switches to utility or things like that\u2026contrary to what you would probably want, you create an environment where only things like memecoins have any real traction, because they literally, by definition, cannot offer anything of a tangible value.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arca doesn\u2019t have any plans for \u201cspecific lobbying,\u201d Steinberg said. But the new company will continue to be a \u201csteward\u201d for the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more clarity, he believes, we\u2019ll see both traditional and activist investors get more involved which, in turn, makes him more bullish. This could also lead to further consolidation down the line as crypto readjusts in the next cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>The price of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/tornado-cash/\">Tornado Cash&#8217;s TORN</a> token skyrocketed to a two-year high after a US federal appeals court ruled that the US Treasury Department&#8217;s sanctions on the platform were unlawful.</p>\n<p>Tornado Cash is an on-chain privacy tool that uses immutable smart contracts to enable anonymous crypto transactions.</p>\n<p>The platform was sanctioned in 2022 by the US Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It alleged that it aided the laundering of over $7 billion in crypto, including stolen funds, by <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/hackers-like-lazarus-continue-to-use-tornado-cash-despite-us-sanctions/\">hacking groups linked with North Korea.</a></p>\n<h2>The judgement</h2>\n<p>On Nov. 26, the US Court of Appeals determined that the Treasury exceeded its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash&#8217;s <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/us-judge-rules-software-code-does-not-qualify-as-free-speech-in-tornado-cash-case/\">immutable smart contracts</a>. As open-source software, these contracts do not belong to any person or foreign entity and, therefore, cannot be subjected to sanctions.</p>\n<p>The court highlighted a critical 2020 event called the &#8220;trusted setup ceremony,&#8221; where over 1,000 participants contributed cryptographic data to finalize Tornado Cash&#8217;s parameters. This process rendered the smart contracts immutable, eliminating any form of updates or administrative control. Governance was later handed to the Tornado Cash community through the TORN token.</p>\n<p>The judges ruled that these contracts operate autonomously and do not meet the legal definition of property or services under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). They also pointed out that the smart contracts have <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wazirx-hacker-launders-10-million-through-tornado-cash/\">continued to operate</a> despite the OFAC&#8217;s sanction.</p>\n<p>Consequently, OFAC cannot sanction them unless Congress updates the law to account for technologies like crypto-mixing tools.</p>\n<p>The Judges <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/70EasapqSxH1kLInf3IQrd/1a1ce21cdc6bc903921f45018cce3821/Tornado_Cash.pdf\">stated</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"s5\">We hold that Tornado Cash\u2019s immutable smart contracts (the lines of privacy-enabling software code) are not the &#8216;property&#8217; of a foreign national or entity, meaning they cannot be blocked under IEEPA, and OFAC overstepped its congressionally defined authority.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Following the ruling, data from <em>CryptoSlate</em> shows that TORN surged to a two-year high of $40 before falling back to around $18, marking a 400% increase within 24 hours. Despite this rally, the token remains 96% below its all-time high of $436 recorded in February 2021.</p>\n<h2>Crypto community celebrates</h2>\n<p>The decision was widely celebrated within the crypto community., with industry leaders calling it a landmark victory for decentralized technologies and privacy rights.</p>\n<p>Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, emphasized that this ruling protects open-source software from unjust sanctions. He noted that while addressing illicit activities is essential, targeting decentralized protocols with blanket restrictions oversteps legal boundaries.</p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://x.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1861549058797772874\">stated</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;No one wants criminals to use crypto protocols, but blocking open source technology entirely because a small portion of users are bad actors is not what Congress authorized. These sanctions stretched Treasury\u2019s authority beyond recognition, and the Fifth Circuit agreed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bill Hughes, Consensys&#8217; senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters, explained that the judgment does not mean that the rest of Tornado Cash is also out of bounds for Treasury/OFAC. However, the issue was about smart contracts with no admin key.</p>\n<p>Hughes <a href=\"https://x.com/BillHughesDC/status/1861545321450336342\">added</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;[This is] a good win. One which the Supreme Court would be unlikely to reverse. Another case where <span class=\"r-36ujnk\">Loper Bright</span> helped because the court wasn&#8217;t required to defer to a permissible reading by the agency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tornado-cash-token-surges-to-2-year-high-after-us-court-rules-treasury-sanctions-unlawful/\">Tornado Cash token surges to 2-year high after US court rules Treasury sanctions unlawful</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

While the $100,000 milestone remains within reach, the market may require a re-accumulation phase to digest profit-taking pressures and sustain upward momentum fully.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Parallels with March</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current rally mirrors patterns seen during the March rally when significant supply re-accumulation at lower levels supported Bitcoin&#8217;s ascent to a new high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key driver of Bitcoin\u2019s price action has been the behavior of Long-Term Holders (LTHs), who have realized record profits amid increased liquidity. Since September, this cohort has distributed approximately 507,000 BTC, with profit-taking rates surpassing those observed during March.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/glassnode/\">Glassnode&#8217;s</a> LTH Liveliness metric indicates heightened spending activity, signaling that most distributed coins were acquired relatively recently rather than being held for years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LTHs are currently realizing $2.02 billion in daily profits, a new record, and robust demand must occur to absorb the supply redistribution.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the report warns of the necessity of further consolidation to maintain equilibrium in the market.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Sell-side forces</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Sell-Side Risk Ratio, which measures realized profit and loss volumes against the market&#8217;s size, is nearing high-value territory, indicating intensified profit-taking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the report noted that the current ratio is still below peaks in prior bull markets, suggesting that demand remains resilient enough to absorb the selling pressure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analyzing the composition of the supply sold, the document revealed that coins aged 6 months to 1 year dominate current sell-side pressure, accounting for 35.3% of total realized profit.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These coins, likely accumulated after exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches, suggest investors use a &#8220;swing-trade&#8221; strategy to capitalize on recent market momentum.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, profit-taking is uniform across various return brackets, with realized gains ranging from $7.2 billion to $13.1 billion across different percentage groups.

        "content": "<p></p>\n<p>The latest SlateCast episode featured <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/dimitri-de-jonghe/\"><strong>Dimitri de Jong</strong></a>, founder and CTO of <strong>204.ai</strong>, in conversation with <a href=\"http://cryptoslate.com/author/liam-akiba-wright\"><strong>Liam \u201cAkiba\u201d Wright</strong></a>, Editor in Chief of <em>CryptoSlate</em>, and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/nate-whitehill/\"><strong>Nate Whitehill</strong></a>, CEO of <em>CryptoSlate</em>. The discussion centered on de Jong\u2019s innovative work at the intersection of AI, blockchain, and artistic expression. His experience spans decades of research and development in decentralized systems, blending technology with creative vision.</p>\n<h2>From Microelectronics to AI and Blockchain</h2>\n<p>Dimitri\u2019s journey began with a foundation in microelectronics and systems theory. As he explained, this background provided a deep understanding of complex systems and their optimization. His work in the 2010s revolved around using machine learning to simulate rare events and improve microchip designs for diverse environments, from space missions to nuclear reactors.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI specialized in systems theory and nonlinear systems to optimize designs in virtual environments,\u201d said Dimitri. \u201cThat foundation translates directly into understanding decentralized systems.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This knowledge eventually led him to blockchain and AI, where he developed data sovereignty solutions such as <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ocean-protocol/\"><strong>Ocean Protocol</strong></a>, a decentralized data exchange, and <strong>Nevermind</strong>, focused on AI agents and data ownership.</p>\n<h2>204.ai: Fusing Art and Technology</h2>\n<p>Dimitri described <strong>204.ai</strong> as an \u201cinteractive design studio\u201d where AI and artistic research converge. The studio explores immersive generative art, creating unique experiences like stepping into AI-enhanced paintings or witnessing fossils \u201ccome alive\u201d through dynamic overlays.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cWe aim to make AI interactions multi-sensory and deeply engaging,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, we use brain-computer interfaces to enhance real-time generative designs.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>204.ai\u2019s work spans institutional projects and public-facing immersive experiences. From kinetic installations to AI-driven nature simulations, Dimitri emphasized the importance of bridging creative expression and technological advancement.</p>\n<h2>The Vision of a Universal Recommender</h2>\n<p>A key highlight of the discussion was Dimitri\u2019s concept of a <strong>universal recommender system</strong>, which prioritizes user privacy while enhancing digital lives. Unlike traditional recommendation engines, which often exploit personal data, this system would allow individuals to own and control their data \u201cpods.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cImagine owning your data and having a local algorithm predict what you want, rather than platforms pushing content at you,\u201d Dimitri explained. \u201cThis model gives users agency and aligns with their personal values.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>This vision extends beyond personalized recommendations to enabling secure interactions with AI agents and digital services, empowering individuals in a data-driven world.</p>\n<h2>Democratizing Creativity with Generative AI</h2>\n<p>Dimitri highlighted AI\u2019s potential to democratize art, enabling creators with limited resources to bring their visions to life. Using in-house tools, 204.ai amplifies the creative process, giving artists new capabilities to express themselves.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cPeople with the craziest ideas will soon have the tools to execute them,\u201d Dimitri said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen amazing storytelling emerge from combining generative AI with performance art.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>However, he acknowledged challenges, including maintaining artistic integrity and addressing ethical concerns in AI-generated content.</p>\n<h2>Ethical AI and the Future of AGI</h2>\n<p>The conversation also delved into the ethical implications of AI, particularly <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>. Dimitri emphasized the importance of open-source AGI to prevent monopolization by private corporations.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAGI must be developed as public infrastructure with diverse input, including tribal and cultural wisdom,\u201d Dimitri argued. \u201cCorporate-aligned AGI will never serve humanity.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>He stressed the need for widespread participation, artistic exploration, and regulatory frameworks to ensure that AGI evolves responsibly.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>The SlateCast episode with Dimitri de Jong offered a glimpse into the transformative potential of decentralized AI, blockchain, and generative art. From redefining how we interact with technology to creating a fairer, more transparent digital ecosystem, Dimitri\u2019s vision is a compelling roadmap for the future.</p>\n<p>As AI and blockchain continue to evolve, their integration into art, data sovereignty, and ethical innovation promises to reshape society. The intersection of these technologies remains an exciting and critical space to watch in the coming years.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/podcasts/exploring-decentralized-ai-and-artistic-innovation-with-dimitri-de-jong-of-204-ai/\">Exploring decentralized AI and artistic innovation with Dimitri de Jong of 204.ai</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

The currency&#8217;s introduction is part of a broader effort to <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/russia-proposes-digital-asset-investment-platform-for-developing-markets/\">integrate Iran&#8217;s financial systems</a> with international networks while strengthening its resilience against external pressures.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our vision is to adapt, innovate, and collaborate globally, ensuring Iran\u2019s banking system remains at the forefront of digital advancements.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The initiative also signals a commitment to bolstering the country&#8217;s economic resilience. With sanctions restricting access to conventional international banking platforms, such as SWIFT, the Digital Rial is seen as a strategic tool for securing financial autonomy while promoting innovation within Iran&#8217;s financial sector.</p>\n<h2>Regional integration and international collaboration</h2>\n<p>Farzin also highlighted that Iran\u2019s Central Bank has implemented alternative solutions, such as the ACU-MIR platform, to address the impact of sanctions.\u00a0Operational since October, the system facilitates regional trade by bypassing SWIFT, enabling transactions with key partners such as India and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>These efforts are part of a broader strategy to <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bis-cuts-ties-with-controversial-cbdc-project-mbridge-citing-project-maturity/\">deepen financial ties with BRICS economies</a>, which are expanding the use of local currencies to reduce dependence on traditional global financial networks.</p>\n<p>Iran has also advanced regional connectivity by linking its Shetab network with Russia&#8217;s MIR payment system. This collaboration allows cross-border transactions and supports tourism, with Russian tourists expected to use Iran&#8217;s point-of-sale systems this winter. Iranian travelers will gain similar access in Russia by early 2025, showcasing the practical benefits of these integrations.</p>\n<p>The rollout of the Digital Rial represents a pivotal moment for Iran&#8217;s banking sector.
