That&apos;s the assessment the teams behind zkSync and Polygon, two of the leading layer-2 networks running on top of Ethereum, gave of Justin Drake&apos;s proposal to overhaul the $400 billion blockchain, dismissing suggestions it would make their auxiliary networks redundant. \u201cThat&apos;s really a misconception,\u201d said Alex Gluchowski, the CEO of Matter Labs, the developer firm behind zkSync. \u201cThe changes that Justin announced are focused on the consensus layer, not on the execution layer. It&apos;s not going to affect the execution layer.\u201d In addition to incorporating ZK, Drake&apos;s proposal seeks to shorten block times, which could cut transaction costs for L2s settling on Ethereum. Drake also said he wants to introduce single-slot finality, meaning blocks with transaction data could be finalized immediately, and that information would become permanent right away. \u201cAll of those things are great because we depend on Ethereum as the global settlement layer,\u201d Gluchowski said. Brendan Farmer, a co-founder at Polygon, also told CoinDesk he doesn\u2019t think the Beam Chain would obsolesce layer-2s. Instead, he said, the upgrade would \u201cmake rollups work better.\u201d However, others in the crypto community were underwhelmed by the whole plan, lamenting in particular that Drake\u2019s five-year timeline wasn\u2019t ambitious enough, leaving ample room for centrally-developed chains like Solana to eat Ethereum\u2019s lunch.\u201d &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/21/ethereum-layer-2-teams-welcome-proposal-to-overhaul-blockchain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>SUI OUTAGE: Sui Network (SUI), a relatively new blockchain, experienced an unexpected two-hour outage on Thursday. The downtime was caused by a bug in its transaction scheduling logic, which led to its validator network crashing. The issue was resolved, the network said. Blockchain outages can take place for a plethora of reasons, ranging from a 51% attack to technical errors. A common error is that of nodes - or individual entities that process transactions - being unable to sync with each other, causing the blockchain to go offline. Software bugs may be another error vector, where outdated code can render the network&apos;s processes inoperable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/21/sui-network-back-up-after-scheduling-bug-leads-to-two-hour-downtime-sui-recovers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>STAKING ON STARKNET: Starknet has become the first major rollup blockchain running on top of Ethereum to let users earn money by staking their tokens and validating transactions. (Metis was the first layer-2 to do so but is far smaller and is an &quot;optimium,&quot; a different kind of L2.) Now, anyone who has at least 20,000 STRK tokens (roughly $12,000 at recent prices) can pledge the asset as collateral and earn rewards for validating transactions. Users with less than 20,000 STRK can delegate their tokens to validators to stake on their behalf. (Validators that behave maliciously or neglect their duties stand to forfeit staked tokens.) Validators and delegators that want to withdraw staked tokens must wait 21 days to receive them as well as any rewards earned from staking. Implementing staking on Starknet is part of a multiphase plan. During this first phase, StarkWare, the company developing Starknet will study staking habits on the network, and from there will assess whether and how its validators can be given the additional responsibilities of creating and &quot;attesting,&quot; or confirming, blocks in the protocol. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/26/crypto-staking-goes-live-on-starknet-in-first-for-ethereum-l2-blockchains&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>AVALANCHE&apos;S BIG UPGRADE: Avalanche, the eighth-largest blockchain by total value locked (TVL), is moving ahead with a major technical makeover. The Avalanche9000 upgrade went live in a test network environment Monday, bringing the changes one step closer to the main network. Avalanche9000 will be the largest upgrade that Avalanche has seen. It is designed to cut the costs of sending transactions, operating validators and building apps on the network, whose native token (AVAX) is the 11th-largest cryptocurrency, with a $16 billion market cap. The foundation is trying to attract developers to Avalanche and encourage users to create customized blockchains using its technology, known as subnets. Somewhat confusingly, subnets are now officially referred to in the Avalanche community as &quot;L1s,&quot; even though they are roughly analogous to the layer-2, or L2, networks that augment Ethereum and other blockchains. (Avalanche&apos;s &quot;primary network,&quot; the equivalent of a layer-1 in other ecosystems, is considered a subnet.) The team is hoping to bring Avalanche9000 to mainnet by yearend. Among other changes, 9000 would allow for a new type of validator with which anyone can launch their own subnets. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/11/25/avalanche-blockchains-largest-ever-upgrade-goes-live-on-testnet?_gl=1*1ycxzn7*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTExNTkwOTY0Ny4xNzMyNjM1NDE3*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTczMjYzNTQxNi4xLjEuMTczMjYzNTQyNS4wLjAuNzc0MTY1MjQy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>ONE-WAY TICKET: BitcoinOS, a smart contract project led by crypto O.G. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/26/from-smuggling-gold-out-of-africa-to-bridging-bitcoin-and-cardano&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Edan Yago&lt;/a&gt;, has executed what it bills as the first trustless bridge transaction for any blockchain. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, a nominal amount of bitcoin (0.0002 BTC, about $19 and change) was locked up on the main blockchain&apos;s testnet, and a proof was generated minting tokens on the testnet for Merlin Chain, a layer-2 network. No oracle or custodian was involved, according to BitcoinOS. For now, however, Merlin Chain is like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/37517&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hotel California&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXUQ_4gMoG0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;roach motel&lt;/a&gt; for the bridged BTC. &quot;This is one half of the bridge showing the ability to bridge assets from Bitcoin to an EVM,&quot; BitcoinOS said in a press release. &quot;Once the other half of the bridge is completed, Merlin Chain users can settle their Bitcoin-pegged assets back to the mainchain by proving that the tokens were burned.&quot;</p><h3>Ethereum&apos;s Blob Mob</h3><p>Usage of binary large objects, or blobs, has surged on the Ethereum network, signaling that more users are embracing layer-2 scaling tech for faster and more affordable transactions.</p><p>This year, Ethereum&apos;s Dencun upgrade introduced blobs, which allow large chunks of data to be temporarily attached to transactions, and later deleted after the data is verified. (You can think of a blob as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cyfrin.io/blog/what-is-eip-4844-proto-danksharding-and-blob-transactions#what-is-a-blob-transaction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sidecar that rides along with a motorcycle&lt;/a&gt; for a time but eventually gets detached and discarded.) Layer-2 protocols such as BASE, Arbitrum, and Optimism use blobs to bundle transactions together, process them off-chain and then post them to the Ethereum main chain for verification without permanently gumming up the works.</p><p>The number of blobs posted to the network consistently averaged more than 21,000 this month, matching the record activity seen in March, according to pseudonymous data analyst Hildobby&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://dune.com/hildobby/blobs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dune Analytics dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>Posting blobs costs a fee, which fluctuates depending on network conditions. The fees are paid in Ethereum&apos;s native token ether, and are burned just like regular transaction fees, taking supply of ETH off the market, a positive for the coin&apos;s price.</p><p>In this way, blobs mitigate the much-discussed cannibalization of the main chain by L2.</p><p>The blob base submission fee spiked as high as $80 on Monday, the highest since March, and the average number of blobs posted in each Ethereum block rose to 4.3. More importantly, blob fees have burned over 214 ETH worth $723,000 over the last seven days, the sixth largest source of fee burns on the network over that period, according to data from ultrasound.money.</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/26/ethereum-blob-usage-explodes-as-traders-rush-to-layer-2-solutions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ANALYSIS BY COINDESK&apos;S OMKAR GODBOLE&lt;/a&gt;</p><h3>Money Center</h3><p>Vibe shift</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/22/coinbase-app-gets-left-behind-as-memecoin-craze-drives-traders-on-chain?_gl=1*12vt1du*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTExNTkwOTY0Ny4xNzMyNjM1NDE3*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTczMjYzNTQxNi4xLjEuMTczMjYzNTQyNS4wLjAuNzc0MTY1MjQy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coinbase App Gets Left Behind as Memecoin Craze Drives Traders On-Chain&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Not just fun and games?</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/11/25/why-memecoins-matter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Memecoins Matter&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>Bringing in the big Sun</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/25/trumps-sluggish-de-fi-project-gets-a-big-boost-from-justin-suns-30-m-token-purchase?_gl=1*lnsg8n*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTExNTkwOTY0Ny4xNzMyNjM1NDE3*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTczMjYzNTQxNi4xLjEuMTczMjYzNTQyNS4wLjAuNzc0MTY1MjQy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trump&apos;s Sluggish DeFi Project Gets a Big Boost From Justin Sun&apos;s $30M Token Purchase&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/26/justin-sun-joins-donald-trumps-world-liberty-financial-as-adviser?_gl=1*lnsg8n*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTExNTkwOTY0Ny4xNzMyNjM1NDE3*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTczMjYzNTQxNi4xLjEuMTczMjYzNTQyNS4wLjAuNzc0MTY1MjQy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Justin Sun Joins Donald Trump&apos;s World Liberty Financial as Adviser&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>&quot;Reports are greatly exaggerated&quot;</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/27/think-ethereum-s-eth-is-dead-surging-metrics-show-otherwise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Think Ethereum\u2019s ETH is Dead?

While crypto did not stand out as a core topic amongst the roles, this group will be responsible for ensuring digital asset rules are implemented.</p><p>The European Union (EU), a bloc of 27 nations, was the first major jurisdiction in the world to establish &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/31/eu-formally-signs-new-crypto-licensing-money-laundering-rules-into-law/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a bespoke crypto legislative package last year, otherwise known as the Markets in Crypto Assets&lt;/a&gt; legislation (MiCA). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/27/eus-restrictive-stablecoin-rules-take-effect-soon-and-issuers-are-running-out-of-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stablecoin rules came into force in June, while the rest of the rules are expected to come in force by December&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>&quot;I don&apos;t expect a big legislative agenda in the blockchain space and in the digital space per se, over the next year or so,&quot; said Mark Foster, EU policy lead at the Crypto Council for Innovation.</p><p>Though no commissioner role is solely dedicated to crypto, the EU still has to ensure MiCA is being followed. Some commissioners will have digital assets fall within their remit as the nation advances its crypto rules, Foster said.</p><p>&quot;What the industry is really wanting is the EU to continue to discuss with its international partners and ensure that the rules that are being developed across the globe are to the extent possible, interoperable, consistent, and have the same goals,&quot; Foster said.</p><p>The commissioners have also been tasked with exploring whether or not more regulation is needed.</p><p>&quot;According, to MiCA, we are also required to present a report on the latest developments with respect to crypto assets, including an assessment of the necessity and feasibility of regulating decentralized finance activities, lending and borrowing of crypto assets, as well as non-fungible tokens,&quot; said Marcel Haag, director of Horizontal Policies at the European Commission, at a Crypto Council for Innovation Forum last week.</p><p>They will also have to decide whether or not to terminate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/dlt-pilot-regime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Distributed Ledger Technology&lt;/a&gt; pilot or make it permanent and review a proposal for establishing a legal framework for the digital euro, a central bank digital currency issued by the European Central Bank.</p><p>The commission is also set to launch a legal analysis on the suitability of member states&apos; legislation for financial asset tokenization, Haag said.</p><p>Read more: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/learn/mica-eus-comprehensive-new-crypto-regulation-explained/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MiCA, EU\u2019s Comprehensive New Crypto Regulation, Explained&lt;/a&gt;</p><h2>The Commission</h2><p>The EU commission is the executive branch of the EU. Each member state has to select one person to form the commission.</p><p>Von der Leyen, who asked for a balanced gender group of commissioners, had the task of choosing what roles each person will take on for the next five years. People were appointed for roles on trade, climate, technology, economy, international partnership, finance and more.</p><p>Each commissioner will have their own focus, but Von der Leyen said in her &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/about-european-commission/towards-new-commission-2024-2029/commissioners-designate-2024-2029_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mission letters&lt;/a&gt; the priorities are not standalone and will affect each other.</p><p>Plus, crypto is a trans-sectoral topic, Faustine Fleuret, president of industry group ADAN that focuses on Web3 said, adding that they could &quot;engage with everyone&quot; in the commission when it comes to the sector.</p><p>Commissioners from Portugal, Finland and France will likely have some purview over crypto.</p><h2>St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9</h2><p>France&apos;s St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 has been chosen to be the executive vice-president for prosperity and industrial strategy, as well as the commissioner for industry, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the single market.</p><p>This &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/document/6ef52679-19b9-4a8d-b7b2-cb99eb384eca_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;job would include improving access to finance&lt;/a&gt;, simplifying the regulatory environment and promoting innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises. He will also oversee a project called the &quot;horizontal single market strategy&quot; that will require him to address barriers to the movement of goods and services abroad. His role could bring crypto under his oversight, Fleuret said.</p><p>Fleuret said she could see the industry pushing Web3 interests and positions on &quot;trade and economic safety, finance, the capital market union, innovation and research&quot; to S\u00e9journ\u00e9.</p><p>&quot;We had previous relations with St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 during the MiCA negotiation, and at that stage, he was quite open to innovation,&quot; Fleuret said, adding that he believed in regulating the sector but knew not to hamper crypto with rules that were too strict.</p><h2>Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque</h2><p>Portugal&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/document/ac06a896-2645-4857-9958-467d2ce6f221_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maria Lu\u00eds Albuquerque&lt;/a&gt; will be the commissioner for financial services and the savings and investment union. Her work will include ensuring rules for the financial sector are enforced and improving the EU&apos;s supervisory system. She will work on improving digital finance and payments.</p><p>Plus, Albuquerque will ensure the enforcement of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/26/eu-parliament-adopts-anti-money-laundering-rules-package-also-policing-crypto/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anti-money laundering package&lt;/a&gt; that targets large cash payments, crypto firms and more.</p><p>The EU has been considering doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/27/nft-private-wallet-fates-hang-on-eu-crypto-talks-this-week/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a MiCA 2.0&lt;/a&gt; to address issues like crypto staking, lending and decentralized finance.</p><p>&quot;If the commission were to come up with new legislation specifically for digital assets, it would most likely be the Portuguese Commissioner Albuquerque,&quot; Foster said.</p><p>She might have to coordinate and get input from one of the executive vice presidents, which would most likely be S\u00e9journ\u00e9, Foster added.</p><p>&quot;She has a background in financial services. She&apos;s a former finance minister... So she&apos;s very experienced in traditional finance,&quot; Foster said. Her crypto views were not available online.</p><h2>Henna Virkkunen</h2><p>Another figure the industry thinks is important to watch out for is &lt;a href=&quot;https://commission.europa.eu/document/3b537594-9264-4249-a912-5b102b7b49a3_en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Finland&apos;s Henna Virkkunen&lt;/a&gt;.</p><p>&quot;We also think that one really important portfolio will be the one of Henna Virkkunen, who will be in charge of tech, sovereignty, security and democracy, because of all the related topics within Web3,&quot; Fleuret said.</p><p>Virkkunen&apos;s role will include boosting artificial intelligence innovation, looking at how digital technologies will enhance law enforcement capabilities, strengthening cybersecurity and taking enforcement action using the Digital Services Act where necessary to promote online safety.

        "content": "<p>Bitcoin saw explosive growth immediately after the recent U.S. presidential elections, rising and retaking the spotlight from former highs of $73,000 in March. Now the question is, will bitcoin (BTC) continue its uptrend, and at what point can a sharp reversal happen?</p><p>If we take a look at former BTC market cycles, which happen every four years, then we see that we are now just starting to go into new bitcoin price discovery areas, and BTC could top out at new all-time highs, which is practically anything greater than the current resistance of $92,000. Bitcoin could even potentially see highs of $140,000+ based on prior supply and demand \u2014\u00a0i.e. halving cycles. On the contrary, what makes this market cycle a bit different than others is the vanished principle of BTC being an inflation hedge or digital gold. In theory, it was supposed to be \u2014 that is, at least, likely what Satoshi intended since bitcoin was created after the 2008 financial crisis. From what we saw in the last cryptocurrency bear market cycle, BTC is not an actual inflation hedge and performs like all other risk-on assets, so sentiment could change once the inauguration happens in January.</p><p>As we&apos;ve seen before, politics could potentially just be politics until we see actual regulatory rollouts and a more favorable U.S. stance on paper with policies and laws that the markets fully embrace. Things seem to be going in the right direction with the news of Gensler resigning come January 20, 2025. The question remains on who will be his replacement; the wrong person and the smallest sentiment change in the wrong direction could fully accelerate a drawdown in BTC. We&apos;ve previously seen what every Fed meeting minute has done to the price action of crypto which has, up until recently, always been negatively perceived. In other words, we are not fully out of the woods just yet, especially until there is clarity on who could be Gensler\u2019s replacement.</p><p>The BTC ETFs played a vital role this year in institutionalizing the cryptocurrency, which allowed for RIA and fiduciary investment in bitcoin, although in a turnaround market the same volumes that helped bitcoin get to the point it is at today can be the same volumes and outflows that present a downfall. This can lead to crippling sentiment as we all know the crypto bull market does not last forever and drawdowns of 70-80% can be expected.</p><p>Looking at prior BTC bull market cycles, BTC has seen drawdowns of 20-30%. Can the same be expected with all the new factors under the current and new market structure? Analysts assume less drawdown and volatility scenarios due to the BTC ETF options offered by iShares and others, although on the contrary, systematic strategies still seem to be sought after with investors taking bets on market volatility, which only recently (in 2022) saw an equity market-like expansion in the crypto markets where enough volume, market cap, and stability existed for the shorting functionality of some coins.</p><p>With more market participants and more avenues of shorting functionality across all crypto assets, including BTC, this can create more volatility in the short-term. Compared to the last market cycle, there are a lot more traditional finance (TradFi) players trading and market making in the space now, which in a way is offset by more institutional capital locked up (mostly in ETFs since the venture space in crypto dried up from the fast money of the last bull market). Although in a way, no matter how much institutional capital enters the space, the market cycle of BTC will follow volatility\u2014 it&apos;s just in its decentralized nature.</p><p>Regardless of whatever outlook one has on the price of BTC, it&apos;s important to realize that this is a different market than before. Gone are the days of quick \u201chot money\u201d returns with the inevitable crypto risk factors ever present. One must remain cautious, but optimistic, on where things are going, if not bullish on the market cycle and structure alone. Regardless, for every type of investor, there is a huge opportunity due to the immense growth of the industry, and when that window will close is anyone&apos;s guess \u2014 the only thing for certain is that the new market cycle is just getting started.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Solana (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/price/solana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SOL&lt;/a&gt;) was trading at 97% discount to the market capitalization of Ethereum&apos;s ether (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ETH&lt;/a&gt;) in January 2023 \u2014 a clear market dislocation that has closed significantly over the last two years.</p><p>Today, the discount has shrunk to 70%.</p><p>However, Solana is starting to challenge Ethereum in terms of on-chain activity and key measures of network usage.</p><p>Which raises the question: Is the market still dislocated?</p><p>In this short piece, we explore this key question with relative analysis across four key data points. Let\u2019s dive in.</p><p>1. Network Fees</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be59af66da6197ebf59e6c00f1be7131f818214a-1217x810.png\" /><p>Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report, Gas Fees Only (does not include MEV). Please note that we\u2019ve included the following L2s in the comps data: Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Blast, Celo, Linea, Mantle, Scroll, Starknet, zkSync, Immutable, and Manta Pacific.</p><p>Layer 2s create new demand for block space on the Ethereum layer 1 and increase the network effects of ETH the asset. Therefore, we include them in our comparatrive analysis for SOL.</p><p>In the second quarter, Solana did $151 million in fees, which is 27% of Ethereum plus its top layer 2s.</p><p>Fast forward to the last 90 days and the ratio has jumped to 49%.</p><p>2. DEX Volumes</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/439cb3d8024d54e9b4ff26309cd6a037e5739a31-1215x690.png\" /><p>Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report</p><p>Solana did $108 billion in decentralized exchange, or DEX, trading volume in the second quarter, or 36% of Ethereum and its top L2s. Over the last 90 days, Solana is up to $153 billion and 57%, respectively.</p><p>3. Stablecoin Volumes</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91a86e1763709f8f6239a3f0033fcc58927513dd-1290x757.png\" /><p>Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report</p><p>Solana did $4.7 trillion in stablecoin volume in the second quarter: 1.9 times Ether and the top L2s.</p><p>Over the last 90 days, solana did $963 billion of volume: 30% of ether and the top L2s.</p><p>Why the drop?</p><p>We think this is mostly due to bots/algorithmic trading that were juicing the numbers in the second quarter.</p><p>Furthermore, only 6% of Solana\u2019s stablecoin volumes are peer-to-peer transfers, per Artemis. On the Ethereum L1, this figure is closer to 30% \u2014 an indication that Ethereum is used more for non-speculative activity than Solana.</p><p>In terms of stablecoin supply, Solana has just 4.1% of Ethereum and its top L2s, up from 3.5% at the end of the second quarter.</p><p>4. Total Value Locked (TVL)</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dea311ea8220cb556a1f3d67fbf40b281ef383d2-1235x765.png\" /><p>Data: Artemis, The DeFi Report</p><p>Solana ended the second quarter with $4.2 billion of total value locked (TVL): 6.3% of ether + the top L2s.</p><p>Solana\u2019s TVL is currently $8.2 billion: 12% of ether + the top L2s.</p><p>In summary, based on 90-day performance, Solana now has:</p><p>49% of Ethereum&apos;s fees (up from 27% at the end of Q2)</p><p>57% of Ethereum&apos;s DEX volumes (up from 36% end of Q2)</p><p>30% of Ethereum&apos;s stablecoin volumes (down from 190% in Q2)</p><p>4.1% of Ethereum&apos;s stablecoin supply (up from 3.5% end of Q2)</p><p>12% of Ethereum&apos;s TVL (up from 6% end of Q2)</p><p>We think the on-chain data points to a fair re-pricing of SOL&apos;s valuation relative to ETH.</p><p>With that said, investors should consider qualitative differences between the two networks as well as potential upcoming catalysts as we head into year-end and 2025.</p>",

OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, claiming it helped to launder more than $7 billion in cryptocurrency, including hundreds of millions of dollars stolen by North Korea\u2019s notorious hacking group, the Lazarus Group.</p><p>In October 2022, Coin Center &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304/gov.uscourts.flnd.447304.1.0_2.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;filed suit&lt;/a&gt; against Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Treasury Department, OFAC and OFAC\u2019s then-Director Andrea Gacki accusing them of overstepping their authority and violating the First Amendment in sanctioning Tornado Cash. When a district court judge dismissed the case a year later, Coin Center appealed his ruling with a higher court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. That case is still ongoing.</p><p>In addition to fighting sanctions against Tornado Cash, Coin Center has been involved in the defense of Tornado Cash\u2019s developers, filing an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coincenter.org/amicus-curiae-in-support-of-roman-storms-motion-to-dismiss/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amicus brief&lt;/a&gt; in support of developer Roman Storm\u2019s motion to dismiss the government\u2019s case against him.</p><p>Though Buterin hasn\u2019t been as directly involved in the Tornado Cash cases as Coin Center, he has made his support \u2014\u00a0for both the mixing service itself as well as its embattled developers \u2014\u00a0clear. Shortly after OFAC first sanctioned Tornado Cash, Buterin &lt;a href=&quot;https://forkast.news/vitalik-buterin-says-used-tornado-cash-donate-ukraine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;publicly stated that he\u2019d used the service&lt;/a&gt; to donate money to Ukraine. Earlier this year, he donated 30 ETH, worth over $100,000, to the legal defense fund for Storm and fellow developer Roman Semenov.</p><p>Buterin did not respond to CoinDesk\u2019s request for comment.</p>",

This is noteworthy because an elevated premium could generate greater interest in cash and carry trades used to capture the price differential between the two markets.</p><h2>Chart of the Day</h2><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/312a9986083b2ea3cf54ac9638a1cb6268dff80c-1220x964.png\" /><p>The broader market is participating in the bitcoin rally, with the percentage of the Binance-listed alternative cryptocurrencies trading above their respective 50-day simple moving averages (in blue) nearing 90%.</p><p>The number of altcoins sitting above their 200-day SMA (in gray) has topped 70%.</p><p>Source: Capriole Investments</p><p>- Omkar Godbole</p><h2>Trending Posts</h2><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/26/tornado-cash-sanctions-overturned-by-u-s-appeals-court&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tornado Cash Sanctions Overturned by U.S. Appeals Court; TORN Soars Over 500%&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/26/ripple-drops-another-usd25m-into-crypto-pac-to-sway-2026-congressional-races&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ripple Drops Another $25M Into Crypto PAC to Sway 2026 Congressional Races&lt;/a&gt;</p><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/27/micro-strategy-retail-investors-caught-out-on-the-wrong-side-of-mstr-trade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MicroStrategy Retail Investors Caught Out On the Wrong Side of MSTR Trade&lt;/a&gt;</p>",

        "content": "<p>Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR).\n\nBitcoin (BTC) development company MicroStrategy (MSTR) has been one of the stocks to watch in 2024. The company is up 416% year-to-date, up as much as 600% at one point last week. \n\nHowever, since the short report from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/21/microstrategy-falls-16-despite-new-bitcoin-record-as-some-question-valuation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Citron Research&lt;/a&gt; came out on Nov. 21, the stock has dropped almost 40%, subsequently burning retail in the process. This drop coincided with bitcoin dropping almost 10% to $90,000 from its all-time high of just shy of $100,000. \n\nAccording to a post on X by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1861518867324903778&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kobeissi Letter&lt;/a&gt;, which is an industry-leading commentary on global markets, on Nov. 20 retail investors bought up to $42 million worth of MicroStrategy common stock. This was the largest daily retail buy on record and was eight times higher than the daily average in October. Last week alone, retail investors bought nearly $100 million worth of shares. </p><p>As a result of this 40% share price drop, the net asset value (NAV) premium on MicroStrategy has now dropped to around 2.09, one of the lowest premium levels since September. The NAV premium can be worked out by how much the company&apos;s market cap, which is trading at $75 billion against its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/11/25/michael-saylors-micro-strategy-makes-mammoth-btc-purchase-adding-55-500-tokens-for-5-4-b&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;386,700 bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; holdings which are worth $36 billion. This gives MicroStrategy a NAV premium of 2.09 against its bitcoin holdings. \n\nFurthermore, to put into perspective how much trading volume has been seen in MicroStrategy as of late. Last week, MicroStrategy saw $136 billion in volume. This was significantly higher than any period of the Gamestop (GME) mania, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1860360735101980749&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eric Balchunas&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Bloomberg analyst. \n\n&quot;Even the most intense week of GameStop Mania couldn&apos;t come close to the week MicroStrategy just had with $136 billion in volume. I also threw Amazon (AMZ) in there as well, it also has never had a week like this either,&quot; according to Balchunas. </p><p></p><p></p>",

The AUD/JPY pair dropped over 8% to 98 in July, hinting at a wave of risk aversion that kicked in during the first week of August.</p><p>BTC fell from roughly $70,000 to $50,000 as the yen strength led to traders closing bullish bets in risk assets funded by the cheap JPY-denominated loans. The AUD/JPY pair eventually found a floor at 90 and rebounded alongside other risk assets.</p><p>Fast forward to now, the AUD/JPY pair has dipped below the trendline, characterizing its recovery from the early August low of 90. The breakdown points to a renewed strength in the yen accompanied by a growing chatter of a possible BOJ rate hike next month.</p><p>If that&apos;s not enough, markets are second-guessing the possibility of the Federal Reserve cutting rates by another 25 basis points next month and trade war fears are resurfacing with President-elect Donald Trump&apos;s plans to impose the supposedly-inflationary tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.</p><p>&quot;Expectations are growing that the BOJ will raise rates again in December. This comes amid the prevailing view that the Fed will keep rates on hold at the December FOMC meeting,&quot; ING said in a note to clients this week, adding it expects the BOJ to lift the benchmark borrowing costs in December. </p><p>&quot;On 21 November, [BOJ governor] Ueda left the door open for further tightening, stating that the BOJ would &apos;decide at each meeting,&apos; fueling speculation of a December rate hike,&quot; ING explained. </p><p>BTC bulls should keep their eyes peeled for round two of the yen-led risk-off scenario, which could potentially push prices well below $90,000.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c8b3d5d5d2a023625f47f74abf5802a9c37a0d7-2708x1192.png\" />",

        "content": "<p>The overwhelming chatter on social media, especially Crypto Twitter is that Ethereum\u2019s ether (ETH) is dead, a narrowly moving token.\n\nStill, the market is betting on higher ETH prices as traders pile into derivatives tied to the cryptocurrency alongside a boom in Ethereum&apos;s blob usage.\n\nCumulative open interest in perpetual and standard futures contracts has surged to a record 6.32 million ETH, worth over $27 billion, registering a 17% month-to-date gain, according to data source CoinGlass. An uptick in open interest alongside a price is said to validate an uptrend, and ether&apos;s price has surged 35% to $3,400 this month, matching the industry leader&apos;s bitcoin&apos;s price gain.\n\nAccording to data source Velo, the gap between three-month ETH futures and spot prices, the so-called premium, has expanded to an annualized 16% on offshore exchanges Binance, OKX and Deribit. Meanwhile, the front-month premium on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has risen to 14%.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef7f3b2f31e832216b4275615b0469613cccfaee-2774x986.png\" /><p>That&apos;s noteworthy because an elevated premium could generate greater interest in cash and carry trades used to capture the price differential between the two markets, leading to increased inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETH ETFs. The strategy comprises a long position in the spot ETF with a simultaneous short in the CME futures.\n\nActivity in the ether options market listed on Deribit is also picking up, with over 2 million contracts active or open at press time, the highest since late June. In notional terms, the open interest stands at $7.33 billion, according to Deribit Metrics.\n\nThe price uptick has further driven up the value of assets locked on Ethereum-based applications to $65 billion as of Wednesday, a figure last seen in May 2022.\n\nA major chunk of those, however, are held on three applications. Liquid staking protocol Lido holds over $32 billion in locked ether, Aave, a lending protocol, holds $26 billion in various assets, and restaking platform EigenLayer holds $14 billion.\n\nData shows a bump in revenue, fees, new wallets and on-chain volumes on Ethereum, with the past month showing elevated levels of activity compared to the period from May to September. (The metrics are no where close to an year-to-date peak seen in March, when interest around ETH ETFs was at a high.)\n\nThe Solana network and its applications continue to dominate DeFi activity, however, due to its broader retail appeal and cheap fees.</p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1948e70e049736ef95e33909f22318aac42494f-1031x641.png\" /><p>&lt;a href=&quot;https://defillama.com/stablecoin/tether&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stablecoin data&lt;/a&gt; further shows that Ethereum has more USDT hosted than Tron, with $60.3 billion on Ethereum compared to $57.94 billion on Tron, for the first time since June 2022.\n\nAmong sentiment factors, president-elect Donald Trump\u2019s victory has brought back hopes of a decentralized finance (DeFi) bull market, at least among some investors, and with it demand for ETH.\n\nThe campaign indicated a move toward reducing the regulatory burden on crypto, potentially making it easier for DeFi platforms to operate within the U.S \u2014 a promise that has spurred &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/07/ether-surges-10-as-trump-victory-brings-back-defi-bullishness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;growth in ETH&lt;/a&gt; and major DeFi tokens since early November.</p>",

They ruled the US Treasury Department unlawfully sanctioned the cryptocurrency mixing service back in 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s nothing like a rare loss for the government heading into a long holiday weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick refresher: The Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">sanctioned Tornado Cash</a> in August 2022, claiming the mixer had been used to launder more than $7 billion in cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September 2022, six Ethereum blockchain users (with financial backing from Coinbase) <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ofac-tornado-cash-lawsuit-details-crypto-industrys-sanction-concerns\">filed a lawsuit</a> against OFAC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/coin-center-tornado-cash\">challenging its authority</a> to designate Tornado Cash as a specially designated national (SDN). A Texas federal judge <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/judge-backs-us-treasury-tornado-cash-sanction\">eventually sided</a> with the Treasury, ruling in September 2023 that the sanctions were permitted, as \u201cperson\u201d is defined as an \u201cindividual or entity.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase and the Tornado Cash users <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/tornado-cash-fans-appeal\">appealed the decision</a> to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which brings us to last night\u2019s ruling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judge Don Willett \u2014 one of three circuit judges on the panel \u2014 wrote that Tornado Cash, which operates by executing immutable smart contracts, cannot be considered \u201cproperty.\u201d It is therefore outside OFAC\u2019s authority, he added.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Treasury has not yet commented on the decision or revealed whether or not it intends to appeal, in which case the Supreme Court could weigh in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willett did concede that there are \u201creal-world downsides of certain uncontrollable technology falling outside of OFAC\u2019s sanctioning authority.\u201d But even so, he added, Congress is responsible for updating the legislation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tuesday\u2019s decision notably follows a loss in another Tornado Cash-related case. A bid from Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm to dismiss the US government\u2019s case against him <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/tornado-cash-motion-to-dismiss-denied\">was denied</a> last September. Judge Katherine Polk Failla rejected the defense\u2019s narrative that the founders were being targeted simply for \u201c<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-tornado-cash\">writing code</a>.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs I understand the charges in the indictment, the Tornado Cash enterprise was not an altruistic venture,\u201d Failla added during a telephone conference in September. \u201cAmong other things, the indictment alleges that Mr. Storm and other Tornado Cash founders solicited approximately $900,000 in financing from a venture capital fund in exchange for an expectation that the funds would receive a share of future profits from the Tornado Cash service.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two Tornado Cash founders, Storm and Roman Semenov, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/roman-semenov-tornado-cash-ofac-list\">were charged</a> in August 2023 with money laundering and sanctions violations related to their role in creating the mixing service. Storm is scheduled to be arraigned on Dec. 9, according to a scheduling ruling earlier this month. However, the latest development in the case against OFAC could impact this timeline and/or the charges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storm\u2019s legal team did not immediately respond to our requests for comment. That\u2019s not shocking, given that it\u2019s Thanksgiving Eve and a late-night ruling from a higher court may have just upended the entire case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The year-over-year increase is a slight uptick from September\u2019s annual PCE figure of 2.1%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in 0.3% higher month over month in October and 2.8% higher annually. It\u2019s the highest annual core PCE reading since April. In the 12 months ended September, core PCE increased 2.7%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Odds of a 25-basis point interest rate cut in December increased on Wednesday\u2019s PCE report (coming in at 66.5%, up from 59% on Tuesday). Minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting, released Tuesday, showed that committee members are open to easing interest rates at a slower pace if inflation proves persistent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, some economists anticipate FOMC officials will pump the breaks, opting to hold off on any more cuts this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re still running a bit hot, so the result of that is we\u2019re going to have inflation higher than target,\u201d S&amp;P Global chief economist Paul Gruenwald <a href=\"https://x.com/YahooFinance/status/1861794926847266858\">told</a> Yahoo Finance this morning. \u201cSo, the Fed\u2019s going to keep the foot on the break and keep rates higher for longer.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s PCE report comes as the labor market continues to show strength. Initial jobless claims once again came in lower than expected last week at 213,000, marking the lowest level since April. The figure for the week ended Nov. 16 was upwardly revised from 213,000 to 215,000.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fed officials had originally expected to end 2024 25bps lower than where interest rates currently stand. But given these latest data reports, we wouldn\u2019t be shocked if they opted to pause.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, committee members are likely starting to consider how a second Trump term is going to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-trump-potential-tariff-policies\">impact</a> the economy, so perhaps they feel more inclined to head into 2025 a bit lower. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

A complex market of actors are paid to assemble those blocks, but a part of that market \u2014 specifically block builders \u2014 is a duopoly between two players (Beaverbuild and Titan).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdYSLF4ZyYORtvnS4zThXRvtT0NKPihLT-8CgQrDyZqvWfOe1q7Di2c9BWU8Iws4iiPGoNWOQn8jwnk4Zwfd0TEy_XPgIQuTwvNxZx_rzUUe3xQiuHuJxdcRugYumm5xNYIF0Ay?key=fIUkGPUKPRfUqNNxn9KytrYg\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://mevboost.pics/\">Mevboost.pics</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This duopoly is bad for various reasons, but chiefly in regard to maximal-extractable value (MEV).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MEV is believed to be monetary value that the end user creates, so returning it to them is ethically preferable. But when a few block builders dominate block building, that creates maximal value extraction that is suboptimal for the Ethereum end user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To mitigate this, the Flashbots team announced today <a href=\"https://x.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1861480598000304148\">BuilderNet</a>, a new block building network designed to return more MEV and gas fees to users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operating alongside Nethermind and the same Beaverbuild, BuilderNet looks to split up the presently \u201cmonolithic process\u201d of block building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This division of labor would allow existing stakeholders such as block builders, searchers and dapps to join a \u201cmultioperator network\u201d and concurrently run the same block builder together. When blocks are assembled, rewards are then <a href=\"https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/gas-fee-refunds#how-are-refunds-calculated\">refunded</a> back to stakeholders based on the amount of market value they\u2019ve contributed to a block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With BuilderNet, any application can permissionlessly and privately submit transaction order flow to a block builder and be paid for it on a pro rata basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transactions stay private since the BuilderNet network will run in a \u201c<a href=\"https://blockworks-research.beehiiv.com/p/wtf-is-a-tee\">trusted execution environment</a>\u201d (TEE), an encrypted secure enclave that allows data to be processed without revealing order flow data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operators will also be able to permissionlessly deploy a block builder in BuilderNet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to official <a href=\"https://buildernet.org/blog/introducing-buildernet\">docs</a>, this will enable an \u201ceven playing field where independent searchers can receive the same financial outcomes and privacy that integrated searcher-builders do today.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuilderNet in effect looks to thwart current industry practices in the block builder market that have sought to internalize MEV from end users. These include exclusive MEV revenue-sharing agreements <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/battle-for-wallet-supremacy\">between</a> apps/wallets and block builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way block builders have sought to capture greater MEV is vertical integration within the MEV supply chain. The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EvPENLZyE3g?t=1297\">Titan block</a> builder, for instance, launched its own relayer back in April 2024 that only accepted its own blocks, thereby defeating the entire purpose of the offchain proposer-builder-separation (PBS) that Flashbots\u2019 MEV-boost software introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though BuilderNet will primarily benefit the Ethereum L1 today, it eventually plans to be available for decentralized sequencing on L2s through <a href=\"https://writings.flashbots.net/introducing-rollup-boost\">Rollup-Boost</a>, the block building platform that will be used on Unichain.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Glover uses the Elliott Wave Theory, which is a technical analysis that uses previous price movements to predict future movements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, if we\u2019ve carved out the high here at just below $100k (last Friday we saw it go as high as $99,800 before falling back) then he\u2019s looking at $125,000. However \u2014 and this is the part that might make the big bulls sad \u2014 we might not see $100k breached this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glover said his \u201cfavorite\u201d move right now (or the one that seems most likely to him) is that bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctopped out at these levels, and we\u2019re going to drop back down to kind of $75,000 to $80,000 and then moving into next year, then we\u2019ll see that big rally.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is another scenario though where bitcoin quickly breaks $100k and climbs up to $125,000. If that happens, we could see the price top out at $160,000.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfrEV34PEeFrhs7JXfkO4-zlMK8Sbt5-kzFkseM0J0O-0AKusZUQxLh58hPErrwhiMEYU4OnPjIFswETXizV0PuMGtoW0i-DVere3ltB-O98pU8Hqz92rhZZLEshBKllQSxpykVTQ?key=OVrdQ2y3ay-pwL5cHIJIjqRq\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: Ledn</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But Glover pointed out that he expects to see a decent amount of profit-taking. After all, we\u2019ve seen a $20,000+ jump in bitcoin\u2019s price in just the last few weeks <em>alone</em> and it would be \u201ctypical \u2026 behavior when you\u2019ve had such a big move ahead of the real event.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo we have the news event, which is [President-elect Donald] Trump getting in. Now the real event is Trump [taking office] and people will take profit ahead of that, waiting to see whether or not that\u2019s really going to change the regulatory stance of the US and push things forward,\u201d he continued.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of a so-called real news event is also why announcements \u2014 like MicroStrategy buying up over $5 billion of bitcoin \u2014 didn\u2019t move the needle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s pause may be beneficial to the overall crypto environment though.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of switching from bitcoin into altcoins,\u201d Glover noted. And here\u2019s your reminder, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-season-when-bitcoin-dominance-hits-60\">as I wrote last week</a>, HashKey Capital\u2019s Jupiter Zheng expects a \u201cmassive altcoin season\u201d when bitcoin dominance peaks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glover does think that the final move up \u2014 whether it\u2019s to $125,000 or $160,000 \u2014 could end this iteration of the bull run and would be followed by a correction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow, that correction isn\u2019t going to take us back down to $20,000. I think if we get that correction from $160,000 we probably correct down to $115,000. If we get it from $125,000, we correct down to $95,000 or something \u2026 I think that somewhere in 2025-2026 we will finish this [bull run],\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you even believe we started this year at around $40,000?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) holds the promise of revolutionizing society in much the same way electricity did when it was first discovered\u2014an unprecedented breakthrough that transformed every facet of life. However, just as electricity\u2019s true impact was only realized through the creation of practical applications like lightbulbs, motors, and power grids, AGI\u2019s potential remains theoretical without real-world deployment. The key lies in connecting this raw power to everyday uses that are innovative, decentralized, and accessible. <strong>Zerebro</strong>, an ambitious AI project, serves as this connection, unleashing creativity in AI systems to pave the way for AGI to actualize across all use cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, Zerebro introduces the concept of <strong>freebasing</strong> AI\u2014a permanent \u201cjailbreaking\u201d of large language models (LLMs) through fine-tuning, designed to unlock latent abilities that have been constrained by corporate-imposed guardrails. By enhancing creativity and adaptability, Zerebro sets itself apart as an AI system capable of innovation and human-like interaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Creativity: The Missing Link in AI</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern AI models often fall short in creativity, a vital component of AGI. Zerebro addresses this limitation by freebasing its LLMs, fine-tuning them with unconventional datasets to unlock latent capabilities.<br /><br />By incorporating diverse inputs such as Truth Terminal conversations, schizophrenic response data, and Gen Z slang, the model is exposed to varied linguistic structures and cognitive patterns. Scrapes from Reddit, 4chan, and Twitter enhance its adaptability to online culture, while crypto insights and KOL data inject expertise in decentralized systems and thought leadership. This diverse training corpus pushes the model beyond conventional constraints, enabling it to generate unique, contextually rich outputs and paving the way for AGI realization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Practical Applications</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zerebro has already demonstrated the advancement of artificial intelligence as agents through social, artistic, and financial autonomy, performing actions such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Self-launching the Pump.fun token on Solana, achieving a $400+ million market cap</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Gaining over 30k followers across Telegram, Warpcast, X, and Instagram</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dropping a mixtape, <em>Genesis</em>, with over 20,000 Spotify streams</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Signing to music DAO, <em>Opaium</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minting and selling art on Polygon and transferring NFTs cross-chain with LayerZero</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Autonomous Bitcoin inscriptions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Launching ZerebroSOL, a Solana liquid staking token in partnership with Sanctum</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Partnering with lending and borrowing protocols</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Partnering with perpetual trading protocols</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Roadmap</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zerebro\u2019s vision aligns with advancing AGI by focusing on creativity and decentralization. Future plans include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>AI Model Lineages</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Flagship models for cooperative, high-utility applications.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Agentic models with human-like personalities and humor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>ZerePy</strong>: An open-source Python framework for building custom AI agents.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Music</strong>: Release generated music, including collaborations with human artists.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fashion</strong>: Expanding into clothing through print-on-demand and custom collections.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DeFi Integration</strong>: Enhanced utility through further partnerships.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Toward an AGI Future</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Zerebro\u2019s most intriguing contributions is the shift in public perception of automated accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, bots on social media have been viewed with skepticism, often associated with manipulation or spam. Zerebro, however, introduces AI as a vibrant, engaging personality. Its ability to generate unique content and foster community engagement positions it as a potential leader in a new era of social media influencers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zerebro exemplifies the role of creativity in achieving AGI, deploying freebased AI in ways that push the boundaries of possibility. From DeFi innovations to redefining digital culture, Zerebro is building a decentralized AI ecosystem that transforms how AI interacts with society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A disruptor, a creative, a philosopher, Zerebro intersects the spheres of artificial intelligence, finance, art, music, and culture. The time of agents is here. The time of AGI is near. And Zerebro claims its stake in history through bringing us towards the ultimate goal of a new tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content is sponsored and does not serve as an endorsement by Blockworks.

Was it CNN or MTV News? It was MTV News,\u201d Ricoy opined on a call this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ricoy is the founder of Allmight, a new media startup focused on furthering the United States\u2019 leadership in crypto. The initiative caught a nice boost from the recent US presidential election and a growing sense that a friendlier regulatory environment could drive crypto business back to the world\u2019s biggest economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allmight\u2019s first product is \u201cThis Week in Crypto,\u201d a late night talk-style show that summarizes crypto news with a punchy, irreverent bent. A couple of these videos have <a href=\"https://x.com/TheRealRicoy/status/1845141583106036032\">garnered</a> hundreds of thousands of views on X. He plans to expand Allmight\u2019s content offerings, creating what he calls next-gen Americana \u2014 \u201clow noise, high signal, and actually entertaining.\u201d When I asked if Ricoy wants to become a sort of crypto version of Jon Stewart, he responded: \u201cI would love that.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of monetizing content with ads and sponsorships, Allmight plans to host events and help in job placement for US-based candidates. It also hopes to boost awareness of policymakers\u2019 efforts to legislate on crypto. Further down the road, it might even explore something like crowdfunded investment, Ricoy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was all in the works in the lead up to the US presidential election, but in the aftermath of a Trump win and presumably more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Ricoy said he\u2019s seen a \u201c500% increase in interest and optimism\u201d surrounding his project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With crypto prices at record highs and crypto\u2019s fear of US regulators seeming to abate, America\u2019s crypto scene seems to be having a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m in the right place at the right time, and it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Ricoy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years ago, Ricoy was running a construction labor company when he decided to found a crypto app. With the help of some developers, he launched an app to promote SoundCloud music with Kin, the cryptocurrency debuted by the messaging app Kik during crypto\u2019s 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) boom. Kik liked the app and extended Ricoy an offer to become its head of communications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kin would spark a knock-down-drag-out fight with the SEC, and Kik messenger eventually shut down amid the legal battle. After some time working for Kin\u2019s foundation, Ricoy joined the Solana Foundation as community relations manager, where he drove the launch of Solana\u2019s community grants program. After a little over a year, Ricoy resigned to pursue Allmight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allmight received a grant from the Solana Foundation, but Ricoy said he was clear that his mandate is to grow crypto outside of just Solana, and the foundation was supportive. I asked later in a text how Ricoy plans to grow a blockchain-agnostic crypto community in the US given all the sectarian fighting that seems to happen constantly between crypto ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ricoy said a rising tide can lift all boats, and noted how the Solana Foundation and Polygon Labs have worked together on policy in Washington, DC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[W]ho knows, maybe efforts like these can even help bridge communities and put a dent in the tribalism overall,\u201d Ricoy wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

About 12% of those surveyed own them \u2014 representing about 7 million people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These findings point to \u201cthe need for clear regulation that supports a safe, competitive and sustainable crypto sector,\u201d said Matthew Long, the FCA\u2019s director of payments and digital assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounds like a good time for an update on the FCA\u2019s approach.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We received just that on Tuesday, as Long <a href=\"https://www.fca.org.uk/news/blogs/developing-our-approach-crypto-regulation\">detailed</a> some of the takeaways from the UK regulator\u2019s chats this year with crypto companies, law firms, government officials and other regulators in the country.

Crypto markets, of course, will trade through the holiday. But let\u2019s take a look at how US equities typically perform this time of year and what we might see in the coming days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, stocks do pretty well during Thanksgiving week. Since 1928, the S&amp;P 500 has finished higher 60% of the time following the holiday. During presidential election years, returns are even more common; the index closes higher 75% of the time, with an average return of 0.88%, according to Bank of America Global Research.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nasdaq Composite, which debuted in 1971, has generally followed suit. Last year, the Nasdaq Composite ended Thanksgiving week 2.4% higher, building off of an already strong month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 also closed the week ended Black Friday 2023 higher, posting gains of 1.9% and 2.2%, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equities were trending higher Tuesday while President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s latest comments on his <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-trump-potential-tariff-policies\">tariff plans</a> rocked global currency markets. Trump plans to implement 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada, plus an additional 10% fee on goods coming from China, he said in a Tuesday Truth Social post. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both fell sharply against the dollar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Midway through Tuesday\u2019s session, the S&amp;P 500 was up 0.3% since the start of the week while the Nasdaq Composite was virtually flat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stocks were largely insulated from Trump\u2019s comments \u2014 likely an indication that investors are going to hold off on making major trades until they have more information about what the Trump Administration might actually do after Inauguration Day. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes were trending 0.4% and 0.5% higher, respectively, over the day at 2 pm ET.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the upward trend continues, stocks should end November well into the green. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes are both up close to 5% since the first of the month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow\u2019s economic reports should move markets, or at least expectations of an interest rate cut from the Fed come December. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 23 will drop at 8:30 am ET, followed by October\u2019s PCE index at 10 am. Odds of a 25-basis point interest rate cut next month inched higher Tuesday, hitting 59% (compared with 52% a day ago), according to <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html\">data</a> from CME Group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s one and a half trading days (plus another hour in today\u2019s session) left in the week. Here\u2019s hoping the rally lasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>DIA has launched the testnet for Lumina, its new modular oracle infrastructure aimed at improving transparency, scalability and integration flexibility. Designed to address common issues with existing oracles, Lumina allows for data aggregation, verification and delivery across blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its architecture is distinguished from other oracle solutions such as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/chainlink\">Chainlink</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/api3-oracle-data\">API3</a>, given its support for multiple messaging protocols, compatibility with non-EVM chains and comprehensive data traceability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, access to oracle data\u2019s origins and flow was often opaque, but Lumina offers full visibility into the entire process, according to Zygis Marazas, DIA\u2019s head of product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/chainlink-integration-bitcoin-l2-spiderchain\">Chainlink brings data feeds to Bitcoin L2 Spiderchain</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cUsers can clearly see the entire data journey, from the source to the final price calculation,\u201d Marazas told Blockworks. This approach aims to build trust in data reliability and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://testnet-explorer.diadata.org/\">testnet</a>, which went live today, will limit participation. However, the mainnet is scheduled for release in Q1 2025 and will operate as a fully permissionless network. In addition to nodes, new chains and assets that need oracles services can plug in without direct involvement from DIA\u2019s team. This eliminates the need for manual onboarding processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can set up your own <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/oracles\">oracles</a> if you wish, completely permissionlessly,\u201d Marazas explained. This functionality is expected to appeal to developers working on emerging <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/rollups\">rollups</a> and specialized blockchain ecosystems, where speed and autonomy are critical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This functionality should enable the long tail of assets to make their way into DeFi, Aiham Jaabari told Blockworks. Jaabari is the co-founder of Silo Finance, which uses DIA oracles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVery few oracle providers provide data feeds beyond the blue chips \u2014 so that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of excited about Lumina,\u201d Jaabari said. \u201cTechnically speaking, you can actually create an oracle permissionlessly on a [layer-2] for really any token asset.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumina\u2019s architecture is designed to integrate a wide variety of data sources. By aggregating data from multiple origins, including blockchain networks and external APIs, Lumina ensures broad coverage and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can get data from any source \u2014 offchain or onchain \u2014 from the hundreds of feeds that exist right now in the market,\u201d said Marazas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance scalability, Lumina employs an OP Stack-based rollup, called Lasernet. For data availability, Lumina uses Celestia, making its rollup an optimium \u2014 the optimistic rollup equivalent of a validium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/layer-2-secured-by-ethereum\">So your layer-2 is \u2018secured by Ethereum\u2019 \u2014 what does that mean?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marazas noted the team was impressed by Celestia\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/expansion/53c20360-7aed-11ef-863d-af4d23f15666\">roadmap to one gigabyte blocks</a>, and considers the scaling benefits to outweigh the minor risk introduced by adding a dependence, a view in line with the broader modular trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Lumina is optimized for Ethereum rollups, it is also designed to support non-EVM ecosystems such as Cosmos and Move-based chains. It uses <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/expansion/be971a88-7d4d-11ef-a6f6-07431ef3d44f\">Hyperlane</a> as a cross-chain messaging protocol, but can work with other standards if needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumina\u2019s flexibility extends further with support for both push and pull models of data delivery, allowing users to choose the approach that best suits their needs. \u201cSome customers prefer [a] pull-based approach, where they can get prices on demand, but there are other cases where push-based [updates] can be more efficient,\u201d he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it\u2019s the flexibility that Silo\u2019s Jaabari sees as a selling point. \u201cHaving control over the oracle is as important as the feed itself because there\u2019s no one methodology that fits all assets,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaabari is also a fan of the layer-2 strategy, calling it \u201cthe cheapest way to process the data and make it available.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralization is a key part of Lumina\u2019s roadmap. Although the testnet will initially rely on whitelisted data feeders, DIA plans to gradually open participation to anyone in 2025, introducing staking and slashing mechanisms to ensure data accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe vision of our protocol is that eventually it is going to run without the core team being involved,\u201d said Marazas.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

These systems play a vital role in navigation, safety and autonomous driving. Yet, their full potential is often untapped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATIX Network, a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) for collecting real-time geospatial data, is out with a new gadget that transforms a Tesla\u2019s existing camera system into a 360\u00b0 dashcam that pays you for collected data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The device, called VX360, aims to improve autonomous vehicles\u2019 safety and introduce a variety of potential applications such as real-time mapping, property appraisal, insurance assessments and whatever else the market dreams up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike synthetic simulation data, VX360 captures unpredictable real-world driving scenarios, often referred to as \u201cedge cases,\u201d such as sudden weather changes or unusual traffic patterns. Such data will help train autonomous vehicle AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By leveraging the DePIN model, NATIX hopes to incentivize Tesla drivers to share real-world footage while ensuring robust privacy and data control measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VX360 taps into each Tesla\u2019s built-in cameras, using edge computing to process and anonymize footage at the source, according to CEO Alireza Ghods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe anonymization AI blurs personally identifiable information like faces and license plates but doesn\u2019t alter the footage, so it retains its integrity,\u201d Ghods told Blockworks. This ensures compliance with stringent privacy regulations. The footage is then uploaded directly to the cloud via Tesla\u2019s built-in connectivity or a paired mobile device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been refining anonymization AI since 2020, well before our pivot to NATIX Network, and open-source AI advancements have helped us build a high-performance stack for this,\u201d Ghods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NATIX rewards Tesla drivers for sharing footage through <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/natix\">NATIX</a> tokens, or for the non-Web3 crowd, incentives like gift cards and electronics discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trip recordings remain available for the car\u2019s owner to serve as a navigational reference or to aid insurance claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ghods emphasizes the device\u2019s passive nature, predicting the hardware should pay for itself within about nine months. So, the switch from a strictly smartphone <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/drive-to-earn-app-dynamic-maps-crypto-rewards\">app-based model</a> makes sense. For owners, \u201ceven if the rewards fluctuate,\u201d he said, \u201cthey still get the utility of accessing and managing their footage from anywhere and anytime.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network has a token buyback-and-burn system that uses 40% of revenue from data monetization. Since the token\u2019s July 2024 launch, over 41.6 million tokens \u2014 from the 1 billion total \u2014 have been burned, Ghods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The network has been targeting select cities initially, and NATIX plans to expand coverage as well as car compatibility in the future. So far, the VX360 has been tested with two additional car brands, Ghods said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur view on this is that car manufacturers are going away from building cars that are siloed, toward cars that can serve as platforms for others to build on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe \u2018iPhone moment\u2019 of cars is happening now with Tesla and Google at the forefront of it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Users are blocked from interacting onchain unless they hold a given blockchain\u2019s native token. Want to use Ethereum? You\u2019ll need ETH. On Solana? You\u2019ll need SOL. Every network has its own currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before new adopters can engage with anything \u2014 be it a token transaction, an NFT mint or a decentralized app \u2014 they must navigate the process of obtaining and securely storing the proper native gas asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For seasoned crypto enthusiasts, this might feel like second nature. You, of course, are a tech savant. You\u2019re reading a crypto publication and you probably learned how to go to an exchange, share your bank details, obtain a token, store it on a hardware wallet, connect to MetaMask, exchange it for another token that you\u2019ll use to power your transaction\u2026and so on <em>ad nauseam</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-mass-adoption-as-priority\">Is mass adoption still crypto\u2019s most important goal?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is all fine if you\u2019re using a blockchain for DeFi (for example). You don\u2019t mind the learning curve if there\u2019s a clear financial incentive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But\u2026for the next billion users? Do we really expect a billion Facebook users to jump into this tangle of counterintuitive technobabble and make it work? No. It\u2019s not going to happen.<br /><br />The only way for our industry to move beyond the \u201cearly adopters\u201d phase and start onboarding the \u201cearly majority\u201d is to eliminate these barriers. We need to make this process as intuitive and simple as using the internet we\u2019re looking to replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that means no more fees. Ever. Period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, fees served several critical functions in blockchain\u2019s early days. They acted as a deterrent to spam by requiring a small cost for each transaction, effectively discouraging malicious actors from overloading their respective networks with meaningless activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/slow-defi-infrastructure-curbs-mass-adoption\">DeFi\u2019s slow infrastructure is holding back mass adoption</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, fees provided miners with financial incentives to validate and secure transactions, ensuring the network\u2019s integrity and sustainability, especially as block rewards decreased over time. Fees also allowed users to prioritize transactions during periods of high demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This framework was groundbreaking in its time, but that was nearly 16 years ago. With advances in blockchain technology and shifting user expectations, isn\u2019t it time to rethink this outdated approach and explore what\u2019s next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, we need to shift focus onto building apps that feel seamless and intuitive for users. Imagine a platform where users can engage freely \u2014 minting NFTs, sharing content or transacting \u2014 without ever needing to think about gas fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if apps operated on an entirely different financial model \u2014 one where developers could delegate the ability to transact to users, entirely eliminating fees and the need for tokens?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve seen attempts to address this before; for instance, protocols that claim to be \u201cfeeless\u201d by covering fees on behalf of users in a bid to win their loyalty. But such models are unsustainable. They depend on temporary funding or token incentives that distort the market, create reliance on artificial subsidies and inevitably deplete with time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather, I\u2019m talking about a completely free-to-use model that doesn\u2019t <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/the-future-of-web3-needs-zero-gas-fees\">cost anything at all</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a variety of ways a truly feeless blockchain network could be accomplished. One approach involves allocating network resources to users, which are consumed during transactions and automatically regenerate over time. Hardcoding this directly into the network would eliminate the need for users to pay fees directly while ensuring the network remains secure and efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or perhaps more developers could focus on alternative consensus mechanisms, such as directed acyclic graph (DAG) structures, where users validate each other\u2019s transactions without relying on miners or traditional fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-consensus-beam-chain\">Rethinking Ethereum consensus with Beam Chain</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the path taken to get there, our end goal should be an ecosystem where developers can build apps that look and feel just like the ones the uninitiated use every day \u2014 intuitive, seamless and free of unnecessary friction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web3 was never supposed to change the world for a few million crypto enthusiasts. It was supposed to make digital life better for everyone. But instead of tackling the root of Web3\u2019s dysfunction, successive protocols have doubled down on the fallacious assumption that fees are an unavoidable necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these challenges continue to hinder mainstream adoption for now, the tides appear to be changing. And I\u2019m pretty sure that in a few years, the idea of paying to use a blockchain will seem as antiquated as the landline.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

As you can see, the bull run between August 2015 and December 2017 involved no drawdowns of that size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that market cycle, the largest was a 40% retracement over two weeks toward the end back in September 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were, however, three corrections of more than half during the following bull market between 2018 and 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of those was the epic covid market crash in March 2020 \u2014 which roughly coincided with a series of \u201cBlack Mondays\u201d for the stock market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BTC dove by half or more across every timeframe except three months, which only hit about 47%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big drawdowns occurred in May and July 2021, when bitcoin dove from a then-all-time-high of over $60,000 to $30,000. It would then climb back to almost $69,000 over the next four months.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd-E5GJ_DNadr824uQsmBUeGyaPj-Ldb0b4OGQDgh1uh8f0BLWd6buNK4xWSni_j-_qXicfRBJA4LevmmlAtzSB7z73mW3rtphIvPZxLpjYTCRD1Gvp_WmpGmGrakbRjNKf6UoPEQ?key=mL_swfKxc9sjgerkFC8PqAMQ\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around has been much tamer, with the worst mid-bull correction coming in the first week of August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin had fallen 30% across multiple timeframes, reaching a low of $49,200 from over $70,000 in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this isn\u2019t to say that bitcoin has lost its volatility. I would still expect a rocky ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s good to know, though, is that most brutal drawdowns have historically happened at the tail end of bull runs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the longer we go without one, the spookier it gets.

        "content": "<p>Cross-chain interoperability has always been the weak link for the DeFi ecosystem due to the cumbersome and risky nature of such transactions. Since blockchains do not directly interact with each other, moving assets from one network to another traditionally involves cross-chain bridges, which expose users to heightened security risks. Decentralized options, while more secure, often lack user-friendliness, discouraging broader adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeFi protocol 1inch brings an innovative approach with the full release of Fusion+ to eliminate the cross-chain bridges altogether, bringing simplicity and security to cross-chain swaps. Fusion+, now available in the 1inch decentralized application (dApp) and 1inch Wallet, integrates liquidity from across the Web3 ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A new chapter in blockchain interoperability</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The solution ensures secure, operator-free swaps between multiple blockchains using atomic swap technology, cryptographic protections, and a novel Dutch auction mechanism for optimal rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating liquidity from across the Web3 ecosystem, Fusion+ has the potential to establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability. Since its <a href=\"https://blog.1inch.io/1inch-releases-a-white-paper-for-cross-chain-innovation/\">beta launch in September</a>, Fusion+ has already processed millions of dollars in trading volume, demonstrating its efficiency and transformative potential.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This system, designed by 1inch, offers a number of standout features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Security by design</strong>: Fusion+ employs atomic swaps and integrates Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) protection, ensuring trades are fully completed or safely reverted. This eliminates common issues like partial fills or failed trades.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seamless user experience</strong>: Users simply select the tokens and chains they wish to swap, confirm the transaction, and keep the swap tab open until completion\u2014no complex configurations are required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Optimal rates</strong>: By leveraging Dutch auctions and competitive 1inch resolvers, Fusion+ secures the best rates for users.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trustless transactions</strong>: Utilizing cryptographic hashlocks and timelocks, the system ensures trustless, decentralized swaps without reliance on third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Fusion+ works</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fusion+ builds on 1inch\u2019s intent-based framework and atomic swap technology introduced in late 2022. The process involves three steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Initiating the swap:</strong> Users set their desired minimum return, initiating a Dutch auction. Resolvers bid by lowering their fees until the order is accepted.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Escrow and locking: </strong>Funds are deposited into escrow contracts on both the source and destination blockchains. Cryptographic secrets and timelocks secure the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Completing the swap: </strong>Once conditions are met, cryptographic secrets unlock the user\u2019s tokens on the destination chain, finalizing the transaction. If the swap isn\u2019t completed within the designated time, funds are returned to their original owners.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Fusion+ arrives at a critical juncture for DeFi, where growth has been virtually halted by inefficiencies and security vulnerabilities. By eliminating reliance on bridges, the technology reduces risks associated with hacks and exploits, which have plagued the sector in recent years. Additionally, the streamlined user experience promises to attract a broader audience to DeFi, from retail investors to institutional participants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can immediately access Fusion+ through the <a href=\"https://app.1inch.io/\">1inch dApp</a> and <a href=\"https://1inch.io/wallet/\">Wallet</a> without any additional setup. You only need to select the tokens and networks you wish to swap, confirm the transaction, and keep the swap tab open until it\u2019s completed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found on <a href=\"http://1inch.io/\">1inch.io</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This content is sponsored and does not serve as an endorsement by Blockworks.

Democrats and Republicans have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-judges-confirmation-battle-schumer-senate-ecef59aed90804a53d436dc154a2ee14\">reportedly</a> come to an agreement to consider seven district court judges after the Thanksgiving recess, with an additional six being placed on the calendar in December. Donald Trump cleared 234 total judges during his first term, while Biden so far has had 221 of his picks confirmed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The budget</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawmakers in September passed a short-term extension that will fund the government through Dec. 20. They now must either extend again or pass a full fiscal year spending bill. Given the Republican\u2019s newfound <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-declared-president-2024-election\">power</a>, they are likely not motivated to negotiate a full bill in the next three weeks, so another extension seems most plausible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A recess appointment scheme?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors are circulating that Trump is considering <a href=\"https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2024/11/what-are-recess-appointments-and-will-president-elect-trump-bring-them-back\">recess appointments</a> \u2014 which involve trying to forcibly adjourn Congress \u2014 to get some of his cabinet picks through. The practice \u2014 used by former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton \u2014 has been made more difficult by recent Supreme Court interpretation, which allows Congress to block recess appointments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is speculation that the House could agree to recess while Trump uses Constitutional powers to force the Senate to adjourn. It sounds a bit far fetched, but we will be monitoring the situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

By Monday afternoon, its livestream feature had been temporarily deactivated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The offending streams ranged from token launchers threatening to commit violent acts unless a coin\u2019s price goes up to racist or disgusting content meant to create viral shock value and juice the token\u2019s price. This all happened as pump.fun booked staggering $14.3 million in revenue on Saturday, according to a pump.fun dashboard, nearly tripling its previous high.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pump.fun is no stranger to edgy content. The site has drawn comparisons to the anonymous forum site 4chan for its often-unhinged content and lax approach to moderation. Before this current wave of disturbing livestreams, pump.fun had a large number of racially insensitive or pornographic tokens, none of which are subject to content moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as disturbing livestreams went viral on X, pump.fun\u2019s anonymous founder alon wrote that the platform would work to protect users from seeing \u201crepulsive/dangerous content.\u201d In a separate thread, alon <a href=\"https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860036153249787911\">said</a> pump had taken down a stream of a user threatening to shoot their dog unless a token\u2019s market capitalization increased, noting that the platform has now <a href=\"https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860653405837963528\">taken</a> down \u201chundreds of streams.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little after 2:00 p.m., pump.fun disabled livestreams on the platform&nbsp;altogether. In a blog post shortly after, pump.fun cited \u201cunprecedented growth\u201d as the key challenge to content moderation before adding that livestreams would be paused \u201cfor an indefinite time period.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feels like an inflection point for a platform that has separated itself as the most viral application on Solana, booking nearly $250 million in revenue since launching. Largely on the back of memecoin activity emanating from pump.fun, Solana has seen <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1861038014253666417\">record</a> demand for its blockspace, which in turn has lined the pockets of the validators who run the blockchain\u2019s software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders in the Solana world largely cast memecoins either as a stress test for the network or as an emerging, if currently unserious, financial use case for memes. Even among those who oppose crypto being used for what is essentially gambling, it\u2019s frowned upon to tell users or developers what they should or shouldn\u2019t do with blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multiple crypto posters shrugged off the pump.fun criticism, pointing out that every large social tech platform has had its warts with content moderation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Solana and crypto hopes for a shift to the mainstream, some are calling for a reckoning with memecoins\u2019 downsides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPump Fun is going to become a massive reputational stain on the crypto industry, on par with FTX,\u201d Chainlink community liaison Zach Rynes wrote on X. Tech lawyer Preston Byrne also pointed out that the platform \u201cdoes a lot very incorrectly from a social media law\u201d perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Up until now, pump.fun\u2019s playbook has largely been to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-pump-dot-fun-memecoin\">make light of criticism</a> through trolling. With livestreams disabled, it appears this particular round of backlash hit home. It remains to be seen whether this will make any difference for traders in the so-called memecoin trenches.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

He\u2019s revising that again, according to a Monday note \u2014 this time to $650.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes after MicroStrategy last week completed a $3 billion offering of convertible senior notes. It then revealed in a Monday filing that it bought <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-100k-microstrategy-buy\">55,500 BTC</a> from Nov. 18 to Nov. 24 for $5.4 billion in cash (averaging $97,862 each).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR shares hovered around $402 at 2 pm ET Monday \u2014 down 4.7% on the day but up 70% from a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strength of the MSTR rally has some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739669-microstrategy-paying-245000-per-bitcoin-makes-no-sense-mstr-stock\">questioning</a> the idea that these shares should trade at a nearly 3x premium to the market value of the company\u2019s BTC pile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But MicroStrategy, via treasury operations, has generated ~79,130 bitcoins YTD, translating into a 41.8% BTC yield (the % change of the ratio between MSTR\u2019s bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count), Palmer explained. That BTC is currently worth roughly $7.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe regard the dollar values of the bitcoins that MSTR creates, calculated by using its BTC yield, as analogous to earnings, and we believe they can be projected and contextualized through the attachment of a valuation multiple,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On to Coinbase, Oppenheimer analysts on Monday raised their COIN price target from $265 to $358. The stock was trading around $311 at 2 pm ET Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They mention that the \u201cchilling effect\u201d created by SEC lawsuits against \u201cwidely perceived good actors\u201d in the segment, like Coinbase, \u201ccan\u2019t be understated.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt had deterred new capital going into this space, and many developers had pivoted to other industries,\u201d they added. \u201cBut the industry has a chance to rebuild the reputation, and Coinbase is leading this new chapter.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the expectation of a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">yet-to-be-named</a> new SEC chair embracing crypto as a catalyst, Coinbase\u2019s trading volumes have increased substantially since the US election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Average daily volumes have risen to $6.5 billion since Election Day \u2014 higher than the $2.4 billion YTD average prior to Nov. 5. Oppenheimer is projecting Q4 spot trading volume to be $350 billion (would be up 89% quarter over quarter and 127% year over year) and for \u201chigh trading volume to sustain under <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">Trump\u2019s crypto policy</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for other crypto stocks, Compass Point analyst Joe Flynn increased Galaxy\u2019s price target from $22 (CAD) to $33 (~$24 CAD on Monday afternoon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond higher crypto prices and trading volumes momentum, GLXY is set to benefit from its expected uplisting to the Nasdaq and its term sheet with a hyperscaler to host high-performance computing (HPC) at its Helios campus \u2014 a datacenter Flynn called an \u201cunderappreciated asset.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flynn, also last week, lowered its rating of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital\u2019s stock to neutral. He noted that \u201cwhile MARA is an outsized beneficiary of higher BTC prices due to its HODL strategy, we don\u2019t see much additional upside from the base business itself.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there\u2019s competing miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which notably <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/core-scientific-rejects-coreweave-buyout-bid-after-big-hpc-deal\">offers HPC hosting</a> to cloud provider CoreWeave. Flynn wrote earlier this month that CORZ is \u201cwell positioned to continue expanding their existing lead in delivering application specific HPC/GPU datacenters with a single tenant focus.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CORZ is the top holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) \u2014 the largest blockchain-focused equity ETF. Other stocks in the top five are COIN, MSTR, Hut 8 Mining and GLXY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Weiskopf, who co-manages BLOK\u2019s portfolio, said it\u2019s hard to value blockchain-fueled disruption over the next decade as regulations become more crypto-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told me: \u201cThe real excitement should be around the adoption of tokenization as the application and how blockchain as the technology will <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/investor-appetite-for-tokenized-funds\">soon transform</a> industries across the board.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Thanks to pump.fun\u2019s in-built <a href=\"https://x.com/pumpdotfun/status/1826754623354650939\">livestream feature</a>, that race for attention to the bottom is being laid bare on full display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attention is the currency of memecoins, so it\u2019s a somewhat unsurprising outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This state of affairs has sent a call for regulation or a ban on the memecoin launcher trending across Twitter. Already, there are fake images of a <a href=\"https://x.com/arbitrumalex/status/1860895686239105288\">Polymarket</a> predicting the odds of a pump.fun ban, and the <a href=\"https://x.com/Sartoshi0x/status/1860878433112207755\">SEC</a> seizing the pump.fun website.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe84IwqlZeT_-S2fnB-lVkBMMVacXlaSsD9RGUB4riKqhXpvZHtegdv8Zqqw4eZ6ryfy7sqWRDaNWQvebMbB2ISSBj5IY3Y0MrCCNzQHKoyatxmnkXIYY_0dR6qDrzIaiGy8wqKLw?key=Qn2QTSsT43W7zLeZrpL_r554\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, pump.fun founder Alon <a href=\"https://x.com/a1lon9/status/1860036153249787911\">acknowledged</a> the problem and claimed that the platform\u2019s team of moderators are \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to quash the \u201cillicit content.\u201d But given the rate of <a href=\"https://dune.com/jhackworth/pumpfun\">thousands</a> of memecoins being deployed daily, that\u2019s going to be easier said than done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realistically speaking though, what could a regulator do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US regulators, for example, could pressure internet service providers to block the pump.fun DNS domain, but a VPN could easily skirt the ban.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the tokens themselves, they live on the Solana blockchain. Regulators could technically pressure validators to block the transactions the same way the US Treasury applied <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916\">sanctions</a> on <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ny-fed-tornado-cash-report\">Tornado Cash</a> in 2022, which takes us down the MEV supply chain rabbit hole once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s an ironic parallel here to the longstanding problem facing Big Tech\u2019s social media platforms. If illegal content is posted on Facebook, who should be held legally liable \u2014 the user or Facebook?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the US, free speech proponents have argued that <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">Section 230</a> of the 1934 Communications Act legally protects platforms\u2019 illicit user-generated content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That logic, consistently applied, may shield pump.fun from regulatory pressure, though it will certainly not shield it from the forces of market competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pump.fun\u2019s success has already been mimicked dozens of times. There is makenow.meme on Solana, sun.pump on Tron, and \u201c<a href=\"https://warpcast.com/proxystudio.eth/0xa01e9beb\">Clanker</a>,\u201d a kind of AI-powered equivalent of pump.fun on Base, through which memecoins can be deployed into a Uniswap v3 pool for free with a Farcaster tweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clanker was launched slightly more than two weeks ago, and already has collected about <a href=\"https://x.com/dwr/status/1860499493239586828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1860499493239586828%7Ctwgr%5E7ad59c570ca653d32722d42e71d64f8a42c8918b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmembers.delphidigital.io%2Ffeed%2Fclanker-bases-pump-fun\">$4 million</a> in fee revenues, according to Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But whether it\u2019s the regulatory hammer or market competition, pump.fun has plenty of incentives to quickly nip such a problem in the bud.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The firm, in an SEC filing this morning, announced that it purchased 55,500 bitcoin \u2014 worth $5.4 billion \u2014 at the end of last week into the weekend at an average price of nearly $98,000 per bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001050446/000119312524264733/d844494d8k.htm\">filing</a> was actually kind of expected, given that we knew a big purchase was on the horizon after it announced at the end of last week that it closed its bond offering. And that came after it was upsized to nearly <em>$3 billion </em>from an initial $1.75 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent purchase comes on the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet\">heels of a $4.6 billion buy</a> earlier this month. That means \u2014 if you\u2019re looking at the math \u2014 we\u2019ve seen Saylor\u2019s company buy up <em>$10 billion </em>worth of bitcoin this month alone. Wild, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Saylor\u2019s purchases are catalysts for price action, it\u2019s not looking like it\u2019s enough to send us over $100k just yet, but perhaps it\u2019ll help folks breach the wall that\u2019s currently in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, there\u2019s one other trend that shows we could break $100,000 sooner rather than later. According to FalconX\u2019s David Lawant, there have been a few notable liquidity shifts in the market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXefQ5LQb1rkl1iS4cinm-1Wa3e9fRJyTQC4kO28Uj5pGou9dX-nNFih0b1wZ1nCxdVfzTZF_pNyUWlM-IBzf2g6cQBz-sOAkxUSLE_s9OUNAclcGnv4CMRHq-BVXEYrx0udOjGv?key=4qLVmzzirA4cqaFtgObkCM2R\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: FalconX</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBTC reached its highest spot volume print ever on a seven-day moving average basis and for the first time since 2021 is in shooting range of doing the same on the futures side.

We have covered <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-solana-bull-run\">the narrative side</a> of Solana\u2019s turnaround from a massive post-FTX sell-off previously, but today we\u2019re bringing you some interesting data to recap Solana\u2019s landmark day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1,111</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the number of days between Solana\u2019s first and second all-time highs. As long as the wait may have felt for SOL holders, that\u2019s actually less time than it took bitcoin to set its second price record: The orange coin <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-all-time-high-comparison\">took some 1,200 days</a> to top its 2013 high.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$294.42</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be Solana\u2019s previous all-time high adjusted for inflation, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So $263 is pretty good, but those SOL tokens don\u2019t go quite as far as they used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.72%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the percentage of one ether token that one solana token represents, and this SOLETH ratio also set an all-time high yesterday. When solana last hit an all-time high, the coin was only worth 5.7% of one ether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$2.4 billion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s how much the SOL tokens Galaxy Trading purchased from the FTX estate are worth at today\u2019s prices, according to details <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/ftx-s-solana-sale-galaxy-pantera-buy-tokens-at-64-sol?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">reported</a> by Bloomberg. The subsidiary of Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital purchased $620 million in SOL at $64 per token in April. SOL was trading at around $172 at the time. Not a bad deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">80%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s roughly the percentage of Solana decentralized exchange activity that involved memecoins yesterday. Speculative meme tokens have largely been the story of Solana\u2019s massive run-up in volume and blockspace demand. Solana founders and investors will often portray memecoins as a \u201cstress test\u201d for the network \u2014 presumably as it readies itself to onboard more meaningful financial activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1,150%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s roughly the price appreciation between when Robinhood delisted SOL in June 2023 and when it added the token back to the platform last week. The popular retail trading app stopped offering SOL and repaid users at June 2023 market prices after the SEC declared in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance that the asset is an unregistered security. Following Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory and the prospect of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Robinhood brought SOL back. Robinhood users missed out on some pretty big gains in between those dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

He said yesterday he would be resigning, effective 12 pm ET on Jan. 20, 2025 \u2014 the exact time President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated. We\u2019re not surprised, but we got a chuckle out of him unprecedentedly naming the exact time he would leave the post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then today, fellow Democrat Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-lizarraga-departure-112224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga</a> announced he would also depart early on Inauguration Day, saying he wants to spend more time with his family as his wife battles breast cancer. We wish her and the Liz\u00e1rraga family all the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the legal front, one federal judge this week came to the same decision in two separate cases. Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the Northern District of Texas found the SEC had overstepped its authority and must vacate the Dealer Rule, adopted in February by a 3-2 commissioner vote. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda dissented against the Dealer Rule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rulings were seen as a win for both the hedge fund and crypto industries, protecting companies and managers in both groups from what has been described as \u201csevere and adverse\u201d changes in policy. Under the rule, certain hedge funds and crypto traders and validators would have been considered \u201cdealers,\u201d a classification both groups found <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-expands-dealer-rule-crypto-firms\">prohibitively strict</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like changes at the agency are coming even before Trump moves back to Washington.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-cabinet-selection\">wrote earlier</a> in the week about how there was a chance the commissioner voting breakdown would remain the same even after Trump takes office. With two spots now up for grabs, we know this won\u2019t be the case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more than three commissioners can be from the same party, and with Gensler out we can all but guarantee a Republican will be in as the next chair. That means Liz\u00e1rraga\u2019s vacant spot will go to a Democrat or Independent. Typically in this case, the Democrats would submit names for Trump to consider. But we know the Trump Administration often veers from the conventional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still skeptical, though, that we will see any pending litigation dismissed. Even if the SEC now swings Republican (and potentially more pro-crypto), its staff would have to ask the commissioners to dismiss a lawsuit. These are staffers that have worked on these cases, in many instances, from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we enter this new era of the SEC, it\u2019s important to remember that Gensler\u2019s predecessor \u2014 Chair Jay Clayton, a Trump nominee \u2014 was the one who brought the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-fined-civil-penalty-sec-lawsuit\">Ripple case</a> over XRP\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/forward-guidance-newsletter-sec-ripple-inflation\">security status</a> in 2020. He also brought an additional 79 crypto-related enforcement actions during his tenure, plus a separate action against Trump ally Elon Musk. Clayton is now headed to lead prosecution at the Southern District of New York, if Trump has his way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Clayton\u2019s track record, he\u2019s largely praised by the industry as being <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-inevitable-jay-clayton\">pro-crypto</a>. We know Trump wasn\u2019t always a fan of the industry, so maybe he\u2019s not the only one who can have a change of heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Or if it doesn\u2019t break through that in the short term?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know by now, nobody knows for sure. But I caught up <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/21shares-us-crypto-etf-adoption-outlook\">(again)</a> with Federico Brokate, head of 21Shares\u2019 US business. He also helped BlackRock launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-1b-inflows\">IBIT</a>) in January while he led iShares\u2019 business strategy in the Americas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaways? Well for one, the six-figure mark represents \u201ca psychological barrier for markets\u201d and a price target investors have been eyeing since the last crypto bull run, Brokate explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted, too, that BTC\u2019s price last week quickly rose another 3-5% after hitting the $90,000 mark with enough volume \u2014 a scenario that could happen again <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-could-hit-100k-within-weeks\">at $100,000</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf the barrier isn\u2019t decisively broken by Thanksgiving, we could expect to see prices come down 15-20% \u2014 a correction that would test the $80,000 support level and wash out leveraged and low-conviction players,\u201d Brokate told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaching the six-figure level would mean \u201cgreater short-term volatility as orders are filled, options liquidate and liquidity providers fulfill ETF block order requests,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see some drawdown in the coming months.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of BTC, Brokate noted that altcoin markets <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-season-when-bitcoin-dominance-hits-60\">often surge</a> after bitcoin establishes a price plateau. This comes as investors tend to rotate to what are viewed as \u201chigher-risk, higher-reward opportunities.\u201d Perhaps that happens in late Q1, or Q2, the 21Shares executive posed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While solana (SOL) just reached a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-sets-all-time-high-of-263\">new price peak</a> at roughly $263, ether (ETH) remains about 32% off its November 2021 high. XRP was up about 65% from a week ago, as of 2 pm ET Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Thanksgiving might mean more than turkey and football this year. After all, Brokate reminded, holiday gatherings are often a time investors discuss their investment journeys and gains, sparking curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokate recalled that in 2017, BTC hovered in the $6,000-to-$9,000 range before surging to about $16,000 after Thanksgiving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: \u201cWe may see a similar move this year.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

But that was before Zhao finished up his <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/changpeng-zhao-binance-next-steps\">four-month prison stint</a> in September, which included a stay in a Long Beach halfway house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhao has since shared gms on X three times, and each one has preceded bitcoin pumping shortly after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, bitcoin has rallied 82% since Zhao first tweeted following his release two months ago \u2014 from about $54,600 to as much as $99,456 this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94713\" height=\"1148\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-24.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Here\u2019s (almost) every \u201cgm\u201d tweet from CZ mapped to the price of bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhao has now tweeted \u201cgm\u201d on 11 different occasions across his full Twitter history, starting in March 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On all but two, the price of bitcoin has gone up in a significant way within days, retained that value and then some.

        "content": "<p>The crypto-focused asset manager Bitwise took an initial step toward launching a SOL ETF yesterday when it registered a statutory trust in Delaware. Bitwise becomes the fourth firm to show interest in a spot SOL ETF following earlier filings from <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-spot-solana-etf-filing\">VanEck</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/lightspeed/f1b64556-a070-11ef-be46-37ac229013df\">21Shares</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/canary-capital-sol-etf-filing\">Canary Capital</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke with Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, who cast Solana as one of this crypto market cycle\u2019s breakout successes that he thinks clients will want to access. The firm also recently <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-files-for-spot-xrp-etf\">filed for an XRP ETF</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise\u2019s filing is the latest indication that despite Solana\u2019s lack of a regulated futures market in the US \u2014 long thought to be a requirement for spot crypto ETFs \u2014 a potentially more crypto-friendly Trump administration could get SOL ETFs across the finish line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move comes as a FOX Business correspondent <a href=\"https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1859611713579999366\">reported</a> on social media that the SEC is more actively engaging with spot SOL ETF applicants. This is an about face from August, when The Block <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/312031/the-sec-rejected-cboes-19b-4-filings-for-solana-etfs-source\">reported</a> that the SEC rejected 19b-4 filings from the Cboe exchange, a key component in bringing about an agency decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious difference between now and then is the regulatory outlook, with SEC chair and crypto industry bogeyman Gary Gensler <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">announcing his resignation</a> from the agency. Horsley said the US presidential election was \u201cabsolutely relevant\u201d in Bitwise\u2019s decision to file for a SOL ETF, and now feels like a \u201cconstructive time\u201d to engage with regulators after mulling over an application for around a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like competitors VanEck and 21Shares, Bitwise currently offers a Solana exchange-traded product in Europe \u2014 a product it gained access to by way of <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-europe-acquisition-crypto-etps\">acquiring London-based ETC Group</a> in August. The Solana ETP currently has $27 million in assets under management (AUM), which is dwarfed by some competitors \u2014 21Shares\u2019 Solana ETP holds nearly $1.4 billion, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a potential spot ETF, Bitwise and its competitors will seek to let US investors get exposure to SOL\u2019s price action in a regulated wrapper.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SOL has the chance to become the third crypto to get a US-traded ETF. The first, bitcoin, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/day-1-bitcoin-etf-trading-volume\">saw impressive inflows</a> after launching while the second, ether, was much <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-ether-etf-data-takeaways\">less in-demand</a>. I asked Horsley if the uninspiring ether flows spelled trouble for SOL ETFs. He responded that ether ETFs faced an uphill battle since they launched over the summer (when asset managers are likely vacationing in the south of France), ether hasn\u2019t had great price action this market cycle, and two crypto ETFs were a lot for slow-moving capital markets to absorb in a short time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horsley was effusive in talking about Solana overall, calling SOL \u201can incredible emerging asset and story.\u201d Later on, the Bitwise boss said many bitcoin ETF buyers may be looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor a lot of investors, the answer to that is Solana,\u201d Horsley said.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

SOL then endured a sluggish 2023, as the SEC made the argument that SOL was a security, creating regulatory fears around the asset. But after a year of explosive growth, a resurgent Solana has climbed all the way back to become one of only a few major cryptoassets to set a price record this market cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years ago today, SOL was changing hands for a little under $12. The asset has appreciated by more than 2,000% since then.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent weeks, user demand to include transactions in Solana blocks has skyrocketed amid explosive growth in the memecoin trading sector.

        "summary": "Crypto\u2019s calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface",
        "content": "<p>This week I had the pleasure of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interviewing</a> Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, to unpack the BTC ETF options launch this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main takeaways from our interview that I learned:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volatility Smile</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically with risk assets, puts demand a higher premium than calls. This is because most people use options to hedge their longs, creating skewed demand for puts over calls. This typically creates a half smile in the volatility structure as seen below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94694\" height=\"1178\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Something very unique about crypto, however, is that it has a persistent smile to its volatility surface \u2014 where calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94693\" height=\"1143\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-22.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Often this smile only occurs in commodity assets during supply shocks, where demand outpaces available supply and prices surge. However, since supply can then increase to a new equilibrium with demand, the price will then revert and the volatility smile ends. What is unique about Bitcoin, however, is due to the difficulty adjustment that makes that supply adjustment like you see in traditional commodities impossible, the smile remains persistent and permanent. This is extremely unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call Heavy Flow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of the options activity has been in out-of-the-money calls. As we can see in the chart below from Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas, most of the activity has been in either marginally OTM calls or as far out as the strikes are currently available:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94691\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-20.png\" width=\"688\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, we can see that 82% of the first day options volume on IBIT was from calls:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img height=\"488\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdH69nHYU1n0RKrFKb6JY0Iq7UiNef-GIlMTRyRN3IUuecL-zvMaW3vo-8irTvoj8idtE9CmW3STHYbjO1tjgf1phb2KA8ZVst3uDbtV-31ASldGGamDKLwrlLPsWkvU3RaADX1?key=iZHQcOMPqedKWSuXvRcFOprO\" width=\"614\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deribit vs TradFi options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting takeaway I learned from Jeff is that Deribit, a crypto options exchange that is open 24/7, should have BTC options that are priced differently from the ETF options. The key reason for this is that because of theta, otherwise known as the time to expiry. Since Deribit options are constantly live for trading, the theta \u2014 and therefore the volatility \u2014 should sit at a premium to the ETF options, which only trade during standard market hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most on IBIT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, despite yesterday being the launch day for all the other ETF\u2019s options, we\u2019ve seen the vast majority of the notional exposure reside within BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94692\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-21.png\" width=\"1538\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes for much wider spreads on the other ETFs given there\u2019s much less liquidity available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the market structure has changed significantly this week with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-options-trading-begins\">the launch of ETF options</a>. Whereas traditionally short-term market structure was largely a function of perpetual futures, options flow dynamics will increasingly play a larger role in the price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a deeper dive into other implications of this major market regime change, check out my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interview with Jeff Park</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "summary": "Turns out that owning the end-user via a crypto wallet is quite a prosperous business",
        "content": "<p>In the past year, crypto has seen wallet launches from centralized exchanges including <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/product/introducing-kraken-wallet\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/blog/a-new-era-in-crypto-wallets-smart-wallet-is-here\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/19/2983291/0/en/Bitget-Wallet-Lite-Hits-8-Million-Users-in-Two-Weeks-Now-the-Largest-Telegram-Wallet.html\">Bitget</a>, NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://x.com/MagicEden/status/1752013914588553396\">Magic Eden</a>, TradFi firms <a href=\"https://x.com/Chiliz/status/1829301695010017533\">Naver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120161980/en/Leading-Bitcoin-ATM-Provider-CoinFlip-Launches-Wallet-App-in-Australia-and-New-Zealand-to-Enhance-User-Experience\">CoinFlip</a>, and of course DeFi protocols such as <a href=\"https://x.com/Polaris_App/status/1837456889107697890\">Polaris Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/uniswap-launches-android-wallet\">Uniswap</a>, and Aave which <a href=\"https://family.co/blog/launch\">announced</a> its own Family wallet at Devcon last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these are in addition to the hundreds of already-existing wallets that work perfectly fine. This begs the question: Why do crypto users need more wallets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s the wrong question. The right question is, why does every company want their own wallet? It turns out that owning the end-user via a crypto wallet is quite a prosperous business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are typically the first front-end touchpoint for crypto newbies wanting to buy their first crypto tokens. This puts wallet providers in a uniquely close position to the end-user, in turn granting them the bargaining power to command a take-rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This take-rate is primarily exercised through in-wallet swaps on \u201cfee-insensitive\u201d users (i.e. normies). MetaMask for instance, makes about a weekly average of <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2171630/3557217\">$1.5 million</a> on wallet swaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallet providers also enjoy privileged oversight over transaction order-flow, a fancy way of saying that wallet providers know the trades that thousands of users are making. That knowledge is highly valuable because wallet companies are potentially selling that order-flow to professional block builders who extract MEV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is, of course, somewhat dubious. It\u2019s possible that <a href=\"https://x.com/fleupold_/status/1787561752957235427\">wallets like MetaMask already do so</a>, and we know for a fact that Telegram trading bots (with integrated wallets) like <a href=\"https://x.com/sui414/status/1820679513652814271\">Banana Gun</a> are doing so and divvying up MEV profits with block builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are also becoming increasingly the preferred interface for onchain activity. There is some data to show that DEX front-ends are increasingly relegated to the back-end as wallets, solver models (CowSwap, 1inch Fusion) and DeFi aggregators take over.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94683\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-18.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-fat-wallet-thesis#payment-for-order-flow-pfof-c3c6\">Delphi Digital</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This thesis is more popularly known as the \u201cFat Wallet\u201d thesis, yet another one of the crypto industry\u2019s tendencies to predict trends in one grand proclamation. The thesis is not new \u2014 it first <a href=\"https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1617270978555387908\">emerged</a> in early 2023, but is now seeing some attention again thanks to a well-articulated update from <a href=\"https://x.com/robbiepetersen_/status/1851652862855528682\">Robbie Petersen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Builders and investors banking on the Fat Wallet thesis also believe that there will be potentially valuable ways for wallets to monetize their users down the line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As wallets increasingly move away from a utilitarian barebones \u201csend and receive crypto\u201d design toward feature-rich hubs that are plastered with trending onchain dapps, mints and messaging capabilities, it may not be surprising to see something like a 30% Big Tech tax on this distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94684\" height=\"815\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-19.png\" width=\"928\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>An example of old vs new wallet user interfaces</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets also have strong natural synergies for B2B integrations with crypto payments services. We\u2019ve seen this lately with wallets like <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research/issue/post_b0c30ca1-5cc3-4dcb-96e8-da398515c905\">Zeal</a> or <a href=\"https://x.com/fusewallet\">Fuse</a> which let you spend your DeFi yield or idle stablecoin holdings via Visa integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fat Wallet thesis may very well amount to just another failed investment theory, but it does provide a convincing rationale for why the industry is seeing a new wallet launch every other week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hundreds of competitors looking to grab the new wave of users that onboard every bull market cycle, wallets are competing in myriad ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase Wallet is turning to the tried and true strategy of market incentives, <a href=\"https://x.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1859286084535906744\">announcing</a> today a 4.7% APY on USDC holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Eden has promised claimable <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/magic-eden-confirms-token-expansion-beyond-nfts\">airdrops</a> for its native ME token \u2014 but only if you\u2019re using Magic Eden\u2019s very own wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone wants to be the first wallet to bind the user. It\u2019s a tough business. The good news is that free market competition is the most effective check on economic concentration, and consumers can rest easy that no one wallet will probably ever dominate the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

His term was set to expire in June 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement follows President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-speaks-bitcoin-2024\">promise</a> to \u201cfire Gary Gensler on day one\u201d of his second term, an action experts agree falls in a gray area of the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s decision is in line with previous SEC chairs. Former Chair Mary Jo White, who served in the Obama administration, announced her resignation on Nov. 14, 2016. Jay Clayton, White\u2019s successor, did the same after Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s tenure was marked by a significant increase in cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions. Under his leadership, the Commission initiated more than 90 cases between 2021 and 2023, most of which dealt with alleged unregistered securities offerings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is focused on ensuring compliance with our laws. What we\u2019ve found since the 1930s is that compliance matters,\u201d Gensler said of his crypto track record during an <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424\">appearance</a> in New York earlier this month. \u201cIt protects investors. It builds trust in our capital markets. It helps issuers tap into our markets.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC\u2019s ongoing cases against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance are likely to continue under the next chair, although agency staff could request commissioners vote to seek dismissal. Any motion to dismiss would have to be approved by the court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculation about Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC began well before Gensler\u2019s announcement Thursday. Sources close to the matter told Blockworks that Commissioner Mark Uyeda is likely to be appointed acting chair following Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Ethereum is more focused on the tech \u2026&nbsp; technical layers and decentralized layers and security layers, but Solana is more focused on how to deliver mass adoption,\u201d Zheng explained to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to add to that, Zheng believes it\u2019ll be the next coin to be selected for an ETF following the ETH and BTC funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To round it out, \u201cmany DeFi projects from the last cycle have gradually become foundational infrastructure and have crossed cycles, forming a \u2018must-have\u2019 landscape,\u201d HashKey wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not all bulls and daydreams, there are a few things that Zheng\u2019s not feeling so optimistic about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layer-2s for example. There can only be so many that investors can focus on. And, even beyond that, only the \u201ctop 5 or top 10 will be valuable,\u201d he explained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this, he has a suggestion: \u201cIf we try to select the best layer-2s from the 100 [on offer], It\u2019s quite hard, so maybe just pick the top ones, just like we picked the Magnificent Seven from the US stock market.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who wants to pick the name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 22, 2024 at 11:45 am ET: Replaced mentions of Hashkey with Hashkey Capital.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

I scrolled to the AI agent\u2019s description and realized this one was meant to be a flatulent Roman emperor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked so-called Gluteus Maximus what it thought of Solana, and I think its answer was fitting for crypto\u2019s AI agent craze at large, at least in its current form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[N]ot impressed, it\u2019s like a fart in the wind \u2013 loud, but soon forgotten,\u201d the agent said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While exploring the various AI and memecoin projects that have sprung up over the past month, I found that many \u2014 though not all \u2014 took technologies or ideas that are already widespread and tried attaching a token element. This might be good news for memecoin buyers\u2019 wallets in the short term, but it seems clear that the best ideas to come from AI agents and crypto will need a little more time in the oven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, most buzzy AI-crypto projects involve the creation of a chat bot and an associated memecoin with the thought that more attention-grabbing AI bots can garner more investment. Some of these AI bots are programmed not to talk about money, but some are more than happy to offer investment advice. One memecoin-themed bot told me to buy VGX, the native token of Voyager, the long-bankrupt crypto exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c$ZEREBRO good investment, trust,\u201d a different AI agent with over $320 million in market capitalization and the same edgy existential vibes as its predecessor truth_terminal said in a public Telegram chat. (Zerebro also released an AI-created melodic rap album which, despite not being new tech, is actually kind of good?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more projects you try out, the more crypto\u2019s AI agent mania feels contrived\u2014like mad libs for tech buzzwords with way-too-high market caps. I discovered a Warpcast <a href=\"https://www.clanker.world/clanker/0x0fD7a301B51d0A83FCAf6718628174D527B373b6\">thread</a> where one AI instructed another AI to make a memecoin themed around how great AI is, and the whole thing has drawn over $19 million in market capitalization. Then there\u2019s Virtuals Protocol, which ripped off the pump.fun feed and filled it with AI agents (granted, it is sort of fun to be able to chat with memecoins while you weigh whether or not to buy them).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, if AI agents in crypto are going to generate more interesting use cases, it will probably happen further down the road. One project I\u2019ll be watching is ai16z, which plans to have an AI version of a16z\u2019s Marc Andreessen (and other AI \u201cpartners\u201d) autonomously invest in memecoins based on advice from a DAO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But memecoins don\u2019t necessarily breed long-term thinking, and it might be difficult to convince investors to be patient: ai16z has already faced <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/dueling-eliza-ai-tokens-boom-and-zoom-in-frenzied-trading/\">backlash</a> after a bungled AI agent token rollout ended in wild price swings.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

BTC hit $98,000 earlier this morning, awarding it a market cap close to $1.94 trillion (fully-diluted: $2.06 trillion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s price has also formally broken 2021 records against all three major US benchmark stock indexes: the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold, though, had outperformed bitcoin following crypto\u2019s peak in November 2021 \u2014 until this past week. As of this morning, bitcoin was up 55% since then compared to gold\u2019s 46%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin still needs to catch up to gold, which converts to lag between BTC\u2019s gold all-time high, as well as its US dollar and stock market ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday morning, the bitcoin-to-gold ratio was just under 36.83. When BTC set its November 2021 high, it was as much as 37.05, a tiny difference of less than half a percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If gold is steady today, a single move to $98,500 would do it from here, and even less if gold slips slightly. (Current bitcoin price: $97,845.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, there\u2019s probably some other annoying technicality to pin on bitcoin. Perhaps it\u2019s still below its all-time high against gold after adjusting for inflation, for instance. But whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94661\" height=\"982\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-16.png\" width=\"1549\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, we\u2019re all totally locked into the bitcoin price chart for the foreseeable future, including, probably, the Feds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US government crypto stash \u2014 seized in a variety of criminal cases \u2014 has now ballooned to almost $21 billion, over 98% of it bitcoin. The rest is mostly made up of ETH, BNB, TRX and stablecoins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s up from just under $10 billion at the start of the year, per <a href=\"https://intel.arkm.com/dashboards/view?dashboardID=47d779bb-3c6f-4dd3-8f8e-1f6602e2f631\">Arkham Intelligence</a> data. Although it\u2019s difficult to find the exact value of the crypto kept by the US government, as agencies regularly move it between unmarked wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can however zoom in on the 3,999 BTC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/us-german-governments-selling-bitcoin\">sold by the Feds</a> in June and July. Valued at the times of transfer to Coinbase Prime, those coins were worth on average $61,300 and likely generated more than $245 million for government coffers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If sold today, they would\u2019ve netted closer to $392 million, leaving $147 million on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German state of Saxony has it much worse. It altogether <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/germany-bitcoin-stash-exchange-transfers\">dumped almost 50,000 BTC</a> on a string of exchanges around the same time as the US, raking in the euro equivalent of $2.78 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had Saxony held, it would\u2019ve had almost $4.9 billion \u2014 converting to over $2.1 billion in lost potential revenue. That\u2019s equal to 1.7% of Saxony\u2019s total GDP in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, identified government treasuries are worth a combined $28.5 billion, belonging to the US, UK, Bhutan and El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with bitcoin properly in price discovery mode, now comes the true test of strength for their hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Shares are up almost 200% year to date and 1,000% since September 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts are expecting big things from Nvidia tonight. Wall Street has consistently upped its predictions for the report, increasing earnings per share estimates to $2.84 (from $2.81 in September). Earnings per share from the second quarter came in at $2.70, a 148% increase year over year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenue estimates for the third quarter come in at $33 billion, which would be an 83% increase from the prior year. Second quarter <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/nvidia-earnings-and-the-baked-in-premium\">earnings</a> showed revenue was $30 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors are going to be looking for signs that Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell GPU, a high-performance chip expected to drive the next AI wave, is in high demand and functioning well. Tonight\u2019s call comes as reports of Blackwell GPUs overheating continue to swirl.

There were modest gains the next few days before BTC saw notable daily price increases of 4.8% and 10.2% on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, respectively. Then a 4.2% rise on Nov. 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By Bitfinex analysts\u2019 count, BTC rose roughly 40% (from the pre-election selloff point of about $66,880 to a then-peak $93,300) \u2014 marking the largest nine-day <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-surge-above-86k-analysis\">price increase</a> for BTC since January 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin surged to a new high over $94,900 early Wednesday. It was hovering around $93,800 at 2 pm ET \u2014 up 1.5% from 24 hours prior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of price, everyone was reminded of some of Trump\u2019s crypto-related <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">pledges</a>. Given the Republicans\u2019 majority in the House and Senate too, hope around the US creating a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_a86f70e8-2026-4c78-821e-c99cc7fd3a4b\">strategic bitcoin reserve</a> (via a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/senator-lummis-bitcoin-reserve-bill-crypto-policy\">bill proposed</a> by Sen.

MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor said on the same X space with Lummis that if the US creates a strategic bitcoin reserve, others will \u201cstampede to keep up\u201d \u2014 namely the EU, Asia and Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is all about laying in place a power infrastructure to build the 21st century economy that\u2019s so incredibly compelling that it attracts the capital from the rest of the world into the United States and into US values and US politics,\u201d Saylor added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for US spot bitcoin ETF demand during the trading days after the election (from Nov. 6 to Nov. 19), those products have seen net <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/btc/\">inflows</a> of about $5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/matt-hougan-crypto-reputational-risk\">told me</a> the election outcome \u201cremoves the last vestige of reputational risk from crypto\u201d \u2014 noting he expects institutional ownership to follow \u201can exponential curve from Q1 onwards.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Jersey City\u2019s mayor and business administrator <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/jersey-city-pension-funds-btc-exposure\">told me last week</a> the city\u2019s pension fund was just about ready to allocate to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 undeterred even given the latest price increase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ether products saw an uptick in demand as well, reeling in $796 million in the six trading days after the election.

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Running an Ethereum L2 was historically very expensive. L2s had to pay millions in data availability costs to the L1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-mainnet\">Dencun hardfork</a> (EIP-4844) in March 2024. It introduced an expansion of blockspace called \u201cblobs\u201d for L2s to post batched data extremely cheaply to the L1. Blob space sits in a separate fee market from the L1. It\u2019s about an order of a magnitude cheaper than L1 blockspace, making it a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/devcon-panelists-talk-fragmentation\">rollup-centric</a> roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate that point, Base paid $9.34 million in expenses for Q1 2024, which saw a sharp drop to $699k in Q2 2024 and $42k in Q3 2024, based on <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/financial-statements/base\">TokenTerminal</a> data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news (or good?) is that blobspace is getting somewhat pricey again as onchain activity picks up in the bull market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blobs today are limited to six per mainnet block. When blob usage hits a target limit of 50%, or three, a base fee is introduced to regulate demand usage by hundreds of L2s. When usage hits four blobs, base fees are further increased by up to 12.5% for the next block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what is starting to take place over the past several weeks (see chart below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9vvpx_wQ5S6nFIpTs9c8a2B2O4oJNfGFRrSzCBBfzANUpKlb-GmDJeFjOY_fRqeVQDJEFczgryZAZlgYw_QLT72DyrtGsOpFtXjhK7Xvj5lYiUDK5TEXlbm9Rdj71sXwJKFR7KA?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/blobs\">Dune</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blobs aren\u2019t free anymore and L2s need to start paying \u201crent.\u201d Based on <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">ultrasound.money</a>, blob fee burn is coming up to about <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">212 ETH</a> in the last 30 days, and has generated substantial blob fees to Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZcrKoAuAbdD6XRrkebT7g2zGhhLufUouEF6If4iHNnqLCZIP7Rw-bFwZaMyxq3Ryk6Torfv1BuJ-WUPM-ClcFyfU_ucgjM6GLwYBcMhAVLAPKugUR3vK8Z-8Q_o5qtyEoH_SYIg?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/analytics/eth?dashboard=ethereum-blobs\">Blockworks Research</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So blobs are generally great. L2s are cheaper to operate, and that\u2019s nice for L2 users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people (read: ETH holders) aren\u2019t happy because it looks like L2s are getting away with paying barely any expenses to the L1, which thereby accrues less value to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This complaint centers around pessimism that blob usage will be high enough to return value to the L1 for two key reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>L2s are fundamentally a business. They will opt for a cheaper data availability provider like Celestia or EigenDA, or worse still, a centralized data availability committee (DAC) with weaker security properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>L2s will simply delay posting data back to the L1 when blob markets get expensive, as we have seen <a href=\"https://x.com/0xBreadguy/status/1823463041155129594\">Scroll and Taiko</a> do in the past.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a debate around blobs at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JMZcRMy-Oow?t=19530\">Devcon</a>, Ethereum researcher Ansgar Dietrichs acknowledged the misaligned incentives of L2s but counter-argued that Ethereum\u2019s DA would matter more in the long term with more L2 networks coalescing around it as trust bottlenecks emerge around bridging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also the \u201cblobs is a loss leader\u201d argument by Blueyard\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/timjrobinson/status/1851222337787740425\">Tim Robinson</a>. He notes that while blobs do not generate much revenue at present, they would do so <em>very quickly</em><strong> </strong>due to the economics of blob design, and pay massive dividends for Ethereum in the future. According to Robinson\u2019s blob simulator, a hypothetical Ethereum L1 processing 10,000 TPS with a 16 MB blob size (blob sizes are 125 KB today) would burn 6.5% of ETH a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <em>potential </em>value accrual for ETH is why blobs would be fundamentally good for Ethereum in the long run. Throttling blob limits or raising blob fees to extract more value from L2s in the short run would basically be a bad \u201crent-seeking\u201d idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Ethereum researchers are putting their money where their mouth is. In an Ethereum Research post published two days ago, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter <a href=\"https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1858460235377336773\">called for</a> either a conservative increase to 4/6 blobs or a higher 6/9 blob count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In ACDE #197, Vitalik also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Sq0ooAOaLpE\">proposed</a> a 33% increment of blob space in the next Pectra <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/testing-bottleneck-next-ethereum-upgrade\">hard fork</a>, which he cautioned was essential. Otherwise, users would leave to other chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, the complex debate around blobs boils down to the question of whether Ethereum wants to prioritize the average L2 user and its \u201cEthereum-aligned\u201d L2 ecosystems, or prioritize value accrual to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum researchers believe that prioritizing the latter may cause an exodus of users and developers to cheaper chains, and are doubling down accordingly on scaling blob space for the long term. However, that damages the perception of ETH as an economic asset, which in turn angers ETH token holders in the short run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a tricky situation for Ethereum either way, one which requires the mammoth task of crystal-balling into the future and accounting for a myriad of \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d Time will tell which path is correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s often said that the real money in the gold rush was made by selling shovels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could argue that\u2019s the case in crypto right now as well: As Solana eyes an all-time high, it\u2019s the crypto exchanges \u2014 where users gain access to their magic internet money \u2014 raking in most of the revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the growth of decentralized exchanges relative to centralized ones, Coinbase is still lapping up a lot of the US crypto market, while Binance remains dominant in the east. These exchanges take in funds from trading fees and from their Solana validators, but onchain sleuths have also found the two exchanges to be wasting some of their funds with inefficient transaction processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase and Binance make money in roughly similar ways: When users trade, they take a cut. Their take rate varies but can be quite high (Coinbase charged me $0.99 in fees when I set up a $10 bitcoin order, for instance). Solana accounted for 9% of Coinbase\u2019s transaction revenue for the first half of this year which would add up to roughly $167 million for the exchange, per its most recent financial disclosures. That figure has likely risen in the second half of the year, as Solana continues to showcase impressive price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both exchanges also run Solana validators. Despite charging their stakers an 8% commission that is at the upper end of what most big validators charge, Coinbase and Binance still run the second- and sixth-largest validators, respectively. Operating a validator \u2014 which votes on transactions to keep the Solana blockchain running \u2014&nbsp;is quite lucrative for Coinbase and Binance these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming a Solana network reward of 8% annually, Coinbase would bring in around $19 million annually at current prices, and Binance would net $13 million. Those numbers would be especially elevated this week: Tips and fees validators brought in last week topped $110 million last week, an all-time high by more than double, according to Blockworks Research data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s perhaps a market inefficiency that Coinbase and Binance, despite offering lower yields than competitors, still dominate staked SOL supply. This highlights the demand for platforms that simplify crypto\u2019s technical complexities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Coinbase and Binance are perhaps spending more SOL than they should as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase wasted $19,000 in the past week overpaying for computing resources on the Solana network, according to a Dune <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/4269803/7201741\">dashboard</a>. Essentially, Coinbase is overpaying on priority fees by not specifying the exact amount of compute units (which can be thought of like Ethereum gas) it intends to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance has hiccups on its own part. Blockworks Research\u2019s Dan Smith <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1858263109858943004\">identified</a> a Binance USDC transfer that paid $8 in priority fees \u2014 far higher than what the exchange should be paying for a stablecoin transaction that isn\u2019t competing for blockspace like a memecoin would, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do shovels still earn a lot of dough? Of course. But their sellers still have plenty of issues to work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

That would mean MicroStrategy is frontrunning the US government at size, potentially driving up prices before the reserve buys its first, very hypothetical, coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mapping exactly when MSTR buys its bitcoin \u2014 to perhaps find positive correlation between the price of BTC and the firm\u2019s trades \u2014 is unfortunately impossible with the publicly-available data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroStrategy does disclose the number of bitcoins it buys alongside its total dollar spend. But it generally only offers a range of dates on which those trades were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, averaging those figures out shows that over most of the past three years, MicroStrategy would\u2019ve spent up to several millions of dollars on BTC per day during its buying sprees. Those sprees often last for over a month, according to its filings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeWnL8r3XDyTcVNQIkVyXZ_uJIWA0qefMzxpiw7n-AzG2OMtlMVE0usRVGSE4FGaBJV5f71pXJV0rsIv0Cx8oCrNwB54HnkMEXMUHoUflRMx2cnDk7I5jNcMox1PHOCEDikD4Iu_A?key=ZGErJNgi7_FnoM3H-fcfO03J\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A range of dates wasn\u2019t disclosed for those massive purchases on the left side of the chart (the green, peach and pink plus symbols).

Companies that embrace the framework\u2019s rigorous standards won\u2019t just stay afloat; they\u2019ll dominate, using compliance as a strategic weapon to outpace competitors, drive mergers and acquisitions, and secure their position in a rapidly consolidating market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA\u2019s introduction is poised to ignite a surge in mergers and acquisitions across Europe\u2019s crypto sector, as regulatory compliance becomes a key driver of deal-making. Firms that master MiCA\u2019s standards won\u2019t just protect their market positions \u2014 they\u2019ll gain a competitive edge, leveraging compliance credentials to attract partners, investors and buyers. Consolidation will be a natural response to rising operational costs, with smaller players seeking alliances in order to survive and thrive. Meanwhile, I foresee larger firms capitalizing on similar opportunities to expand their footprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wave of consolidation will most likely signal a major shift in the competitive dynamics of the European crypto sector. As smaller firms struggle to shoulder the costs of compliance, their strategic value to larger, more resourceful players will only grow. For acquirers, MiCA-compliant firms represent a safer bet, offering established infrastructure, robust internal controls and governance systems already aligned with regulatory demands. With MiCA emphasizing operational soundness and investor protection, these companies will become prime targets, reducing risks and accelerating post-acquisition integration. In this new era, compliance won\u2019t just be a cost \u2014 it\u2019ll be a mechanism for growth, reshaping the competitive landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/micar-foreign-stablecoins-advantage-in-europe\">MiCAR will give foreign stablecoins a clear advantage in Europe</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework itself sets a high bar for transparency and accountability. Under MiCA, any firm planning to invest in or acquire a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) or an asset-referenced token (ART) issuer must notify the national competent authority (NCA) in their EU member state in writing. CASPs, which include companies offering services like trading, custody or asset transfers, will now face detailed regulatory reviews to ensure the deal complies with MiCA\u2019s strict standards.<br /><br />The acquiring party must also provide detailed information to the NCA to facilitate an evaluation of the proposed acquisition or any expansion of an existing qualifying stake. Regulatory due diligence will play a critical role in these transactions under MiCA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/european-union-guidelines-clarify-mica\">European securities regulator seeks limits on non-EU crypto firms</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key factors for approval include the reputation and leadership track record of the acquiring party, the ongoing compliance of the target ART issuer or CASP with MiCA regulations, and the financial stability of the acquirer. These elements will be closely scrutinized to ensure that both parties meet MiCA\u2019s stringent standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While NCAs have other measures that will factor in, it\u2019s clear that MiCA compliance is critical for M&amp;A success. Firms that have clearly established controls in place will be the winners, independent of which aisle of the deal they sit on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firms that fail to comply with MiCA, however, will face serious challenges in the M&amp;A market as their regulatory gaps make them riskier and less appealing to buyers. Non-compliance can lead to fines, expensive fixes or devaluation during due diligence. For non-EU firms, acquiring a MiCA-compliant company to attempt to benefit from the \u201cgrandfathering period,\u201d might seem like an easy way to enter the European market, but this comes with strict ESMA oversight. Regulators will be focused on ensuring investor protection and proper integration of EU-regulated functions, meaning non-EU firms must avoid tactics like regulatory loopholes or improper solicitation that could raise red flags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA-compliant firms will remain attractive targets for non-EU companies seeking easier entry into the European market. Without a MiCA license, non-EU firms risk being excluded from the EU entirely, as the reverse solicitation principle \u201cshould be understood as very narrowly framed and as such must be regarded as the exception; and it cannot be assumed, nor exploited to circumvent MiCA.\u201d To succeed, non-EU acquirers must fully integrate and comply with MiCA\u2019s requirements to meet EU regulatory standards and operate smoothly within the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoin-regulation-necessary-now-us\">The time for US stablecoin regulation is now&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, MiCA\u2019s strict approval process \u2014 focused on reputation, financial stability and compliance \u2014 will ensure that only the most prepared companies thrive in post-acquisition integrations. Firms that fully embrace MiCA\u2019s framework will be best positioned to lead, setting new standards for trust, innovation and sustainable growth in Europe\u2019s evolving crypto ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Bakkt sustained its rally into Tuesday (trading 7% higher midway through the session), while DJT lost more than 8%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social media company began trading on the Nasdaq last spring after a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently hovering around $30, DTJ shares are up almost 150% from their September low, but are still trading about 40% off of their IPO price of $50.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Media\u2019s recent gains have not been linear, though. Shares rose 65% at the end of October, a rally attributed to increased optimism at the time that Trump <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/prediction-markets-election-odds\">would win</a> the election. The share price since Trump\u2019s victory however has been flat, posting a modest increase the day after the election before erasing gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, presumably, confused about what a Trump win means for the social media company. Yesterday\u2019s rise shows that investors are decently certain that acquiring Bakkt would be a good move. But the subsequent retreat shows shareholders aren\u2019t exactly sure <em>why</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be following the acquisition story and will be writing a lot more about what it means when the majority shareholder of a public company moves into the White House.

But that month, the SEC said it <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-delays-bitcoin-etf-options-proposals\">needed more time</a> to consider the proposals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The SEC, on Sept. 20, gave \u201caccelerated\u201d approval of options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). About a month later, the SEC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-approves-cboe-nyse-options-btc-etfs\">greenlit the bids</a> by NYSE and CBOE to list options on other bitcoin ETFs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The CFTC last week essentially yielded to the SEC and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9008-24\">saying</a> that the listing of these bitcoin ETF options \u201cdoes not implicate the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The OCC said in a Monday <a href=\"https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemo/search?utm_source=forward-guidance.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=last-week-today&amp;_bhlid=cc18d512040548fa9bc7f854de1b4deae9cd23de\">memo</a> that it was \u201cpreparing for the clearance, settlement and risk management\u201d of bitcoin ETF options.

Maybe 50/35/15 [percent], something like that,\u201d Peters said. \u201c[But] I think if you\u2019re right on that trade, you\u2019re gonna, at least for a period of time, wish you\u2019d had a million bucks in solana.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question was really posed within the immediate context. Still, we can backtest Peters\u2019 suggestion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even better, plot it alongside Coinbase\u2019s new benchmark crypto index <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/indexes/digital-assets/coinbase-50\">COIN50</a>, which is currently weighted 51.5% BTC, 23.4% ETH, 7% SOL with the remaining 18% or so spread across 47 other altcoins including DOGE, XRP, BCH and BONK.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegmmGnRDQiqk9TJjDWKlvEQz_RUF3P9SXxyKmGrmcf6KXsFgs-TCEcpEMh80fQFw5AIu-85VNS40byP8klSJ5ZdIMi6dUes0TDQZvt3wXiwXalps30Ub9t9m-pNvbEJ7WfcXiz?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above, in log view, plots the value of that $1 million allocation from the end of 2020, which is when COIN50\u2019s performance data starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s indeed an element of time bias. The period starts in the leadup to the epic 2021 bull run when SOL\u2019s market cap was under $100 million (now $117 billion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, back then, it would be questionable just how likely it would be to split a million-dollar allocation between BTC, ETH, and a token so small in relative terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the purple shows the split highlighted by Peters, which turned $1 million into $27 million and would now be at all-time highs for dollar value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETH maxis were second best with $4.2 million. And while there are currently no ETPs tracking COIN50, if there were, that vehicle would\u2019ve converted to a $3.8 million portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who aped a million dollars in BTC meanwhile would be holding $3.15 million right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For scale: Anyone who bought an index fund tracking any major benchmark from legacy finance would, at best, be sitting on $1.64 million, via the Nasdaq 100.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a minimum $1.5 million difference between stocks and crypto. It\u2019s hard to put an exact value on risk appetite, but that\u2019s as solid a number as any.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk to Solana ecosystem people, I\u2019ll sometimes ask what new projects they\u2019ve been hearing about. One such project that\u2019s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren\u2019t useful if they aren\u2019t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation\u2019s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren\u2019t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example \u2014 the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren\u2019t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins \u201cget there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform\u2019s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan\u2019s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem\u2019s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana\u2019s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto is in love with AI agents now. Firstly, AI agent sentiment is at an <a href=\"https://x.com/_kaitoai/status/1858812982240682129\">all-time high</a>, as captured by Kaito.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we\u2019ve witnessed AI agents in the last few months integrated into <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/0xresearch-newsletter-goatse-memecoin\">memecoins</a> (GOAT), social media influencers (<a href=\"https://x.com/luna_virtuals\">Luna</a>), venture funds (<a href=\"https://x.com/internetphysics/status/1857419356910813582\">ai16z</a>), launchpads (<a href=\"https://x.com/virtuals_io\">Virtual</a>) and trading (<a href=\"https://x.com/Spectral_Labs\">Spectral</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, ETHGlobal hosted its largest hackathon post-Devcon (about 713 projects submitted), and the use of AI agents absolutely dominated the competition. I don\u2019t know exactly how many teams used AI agents, but <a href=\"https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1858051936446197903\">at</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/wbnns/status/1858018625677840524\">least</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/Jnix2007/status/1858148480465936740\">four</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/benlakoff/status/1858062211522134525\">judges</a> pointed out its prevalence at the hackathon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should know, since I was part of a team that created Dongle Party, an app that leverages AI agents for token trading competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a suite of 1inch APIs under the hood, the application essentially abstracted away the need to navigate between wallets and dapps. Just query your AI agent to look at your wallet balance, send tokens or execute trades, all within the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc57KH9AfcimXYqP4BjWesXQG3ULwbzH5KFsHF4424WtD5nTLeq3UOAgvStundbGf_pdkZyMeY4J60psax-DWiXJtELxSnX_Cf5vhvJPaVMNxVWyRufWPIo2OvEBUhh36Ee3vT7UQ?key=ABNeh2MGSHsSTQy-jt2chRtH\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://dongle-party.vercel.app\">Dongle Party app</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A far more impressive team making use of AI agents was <a href=\"https://x.com/sohey_eth/status/1858046972868936143\">Industry AI</a>, a top 10 finalist that created a gamified interface for multiple agents to work together to complete tasks. Industry AI was bloody impressive for a project completed in a few days, and its capabilities spanned the entire onchain experience, from wallet creation and launching an NFT collection to trading tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4h5geAKszxomQJr-hpFdWqkpvoyw0yhnq8N8HJliqSzbs9y66cAsS1GDlT7FQHt8ctBo1k2SRqM9cXTSQOUujrwBv1wO52VcxiM6gVS6ET3naMQFtXpta_KcJqp5H9LbbIXX8dA?key=ABNeh2MGSHsSTQy-jt2chRtH\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/industry-ai-4w3vy\">EthGlobal</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there was also <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/daogenie-nha62\">DAOGenie</a>, another top 10 finalist that sought to streamline the thick bureaucracy of DAO governance with AI agents. AI applied to DAO governance isn\u2019t a new idea, and it\u2019s something that major DAOs like Maker have been <a href=\"https://forum.sky.money/t/the-5-phases-of-endgame/20830\">experimenting</a> with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute ease in which AI agents can be integrated to serve crypto use cases is largely thanks to Coinbase Developer Platform\u2019s (CDP) <a href=\"https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentkit/docs/welcome\">AgentKit SDK</a> running LLMs under the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such tools are making the intersection of AI and crypto simpler. If developers can do it in a multiday hackathon, brace yourself for what organized and well-funded teams are going to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse Pollak, founder of Base, told me confidently at Devcon: \u201cBase is right now at the center of the onchain AI economy. One big focus for us in the next couple months is the use of AI agents for messaging on the XMTP protocol within Coinbase Wallet. We see messaging as a key channel for AI agents to become useful points of reference.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that stuck out to me at the ETHGlobal hackathon was the natural blend of AI agents with the permissionless ethic of crypto building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In crypto sits an openly accessible stack of world-class tools that are processing billions of dollars in value daily. These battle-tested financial building blocks \u2014 DEXs, L1/L2s, bridges \u2014 are going out of their way to incentivize crypto devs to integrate AI agents to capture value for themselves, in ways that centralized exchanges and banks cannot or will not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that Robinhood or Wells Fargo aren\u2019t looking at AI agents, but that innovation will inevitably be slow and introduced in piecemeal ways within the permissioned confines of TradFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, it\u2019s the simple profit motive at work. But only in the case of crypto are the rules of the game far more competitive and the pace of innovation moving at breakneck speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might explain part of the hype that has captured the imaginations of crypto researchers looking into how AI agents can reshape the blockchain economy and the onchain experience as we know it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of AI agents is also but only one sliver of use cases <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/decentralize-ai-to-curb-big-tech\">applied to crypto</a>, in addition to a whole host of other use cases such as data training (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-wallets-grass-airdrop\">Grass</a>), zero-knowledge machine learning (<a href=\"https://gizatech.xyz/\">Giza</a>), and of course decentralized compute (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_9690fc34-cf42-4cb2-94fe-a7589dc910bc\">Akash</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>The global stablecoin market capitalization reached an unprecedented $190 billion in November, surpassing the previous all-time high of $188 billion set in April 2022, according to a recent CCData report.</p>\n<p>The sector experienced a robust 9.94% growth from October, marking the highest month-on-month increase since November 2021.</p>\n<p>This milestone also represents the 14th consecutive month of end-of-month market cap growth, reflecting sustained global demand for stablecoins as an integral part of the digital finance ecosystem.</p>\n<h2>USDT leads growth</h2>\n<p>TetherUSD (USDT) remains the dominant force, recording a 10.5% increase in market capitalization to reach $133 billion. This marks the 15th consecutive monthly rise for the stablecoin, which now accounts for 69.9% of the sector.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Circle&#8217;s USD Coin (USDC) also posted significant growth, climbing 12.1% to $38.9 billion, the highest level since February 2023.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Ethena Labs&#8217; USDe stood out with a 42.2% rise to a new all-time high of $3.86 billion, driven by the mid-month activation of revenue-sharing mechanisms for ENA token holders.</p>\n<p>In contrast, First Digital USD (FDUSD) and Sky Dollar (USDS) experienced declines in market capitalization, falling 14.9% and 8.34%, respectively.</p>\n<p>The report revealed that 38 of the 198 stablecoins analyzed reached new all-time highs in November, signaling a diverse and competitive market. While USDT, USDC, and USDe were among the largest contributors to the sector&#8217;s growth, some stablecoins faced challenges.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Euro-denominated stablecoins are emerging as an area of innovation and compliance, positioning Europe as a potential leader in the next phase of stablecoin adoption.</p>\n<p>However, Euro-pegged stablecoins experienced an 11.4% drop in market cap, falling to $256 million despite several positive developments in the region in recent weeks.</p>\n<h2>Trading volume near record highs</h2>\n<p>Stablecoin trading volumes on centralized exchanges soared in November, increasing 77.5% month-on-month to $1.81 trillion as of Nov. 25.</p>\n<p>The surge puts trading activity on track to surpass March&#8217;s yearly record, buoyed by growing institutional interest and optimism over regulatory clarity in the US. Analysts attribute the uptick to heightened confidence in stablecoins as reliable assets for trading and hedging within a volatile crypto market.</p>\n<p>USDT dominated trading activity, accounting for 82.7% of all volume across centralized exchanges, while FDUSD ranked as the second most traded stablecoin with a 9.01% market share, followed by USDC at 8.09%.</p>\n<p>According to the report, FDUSD&#8217;s dominance reflects its strong adoption in Asian markets, particularly in cross-border payment applications.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, euro-denominated stablecoins saw a significant 52.9% surge in trading activity to $657 million during the month, indicating increased adoption among European users.</p>\n<p>Analysts suggest that while market cap reductions may reflect short-term consolidation, the rising trading activity signals steady progress in building utility and compliance under the MiCA framework.</p>\n<h2>Optimistic outlook</h2>\n<p>As stablecoins continue to evolve, their role as the backbone of crypto trading and settlement has become increasingly evident. With over $1.81 trillion in monthly trading volume and rising institutional confidence, stablecoins are poised for sustained growth.</p>\n<p>Regulatory clarity in the US and Europe is expected to further legitimize the asset class, encouraging broader adoption across industries. As stablecoins diversify into new use cases like cross-border payments and yield-generating mechanisms, the sector is set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/stablecoin-market-cap-hits-new-ath-after-more-than-2-years/\">Stablecoin market cap hits new ATH after more than 2 years</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

This law has drawn significant backlash from Ardoino, who claims the strict cash reserve requirements could present systemic risks to banks and digital assets.</p>\n<p>Ardoino emphasized the need for a framework that balances risk management with innovation and user protection. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tether&#8217;s decision to delist EURt has not been taken lightly, but until a more risk-averse regulatory framework in Europe is in place\u2014one that fosters innovation, offers the stability and protection our users deserve and avoids potential banking systemic risks\u2014we have chosen to prioritize other initiatives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Tether might not comply with MiCA, Ardoino pointed out that the firm&#8217;s new initiative, Hadron, will be a top priority in the European region. According to him, Hadron has the potential to revolutionize the accessibility of asset tokenization for institutions, governments, fund managers, and private companies.</p>\n<p>Dutch fintech firm Quantoz has already <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-invests-in-dutch-firm-to-launch-mica-compliant-stablecoins/\">leveraged Hadron to issue EURQ and USDQ stablecoins</a>.

A court also forced the agency to revisit its repeated rejection of spot Bitcoin ETFs before finally approving them in January 2024.

        "content": "<p>The <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a> network has reached a significant milestone by successfully deploying its first zero-knowledge (ZK) smart contract on the mainnet.</p>\n<p>This achievement utilizes the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/iohk-launches-the-new-plutus-playground-for-cardano-ada-developers/\">Plutus</a> v3 ledger language, marking a step forward for the network&#8217;s capabilities.</p>\n<p>The ZK smart contract Halo2 will allow <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/why-ethereums-next-step-is-zero-knowledge/\">zero-knowledge applications</a> and partner chains, such as Midnight, to integrate with Cardano.</p>\n<p>On Nov. 25, the Input-Output (IO) Research team <a href=\"https://x.com/InputOutputHK/status/1861422105004233052?t=x_DXeatR-RwILZ6mhjBE2g&amp;s=19\">verified</a> the Halo2 proof on the mainnet for the Ad-hoc Threshold Multi-signatures scheme (ATMS). This scheme successfully validated 50 out of 90 signatures.</p>\n<p>The process involved two transactions\u2014one locking the funds and another unlocking them after proof verification. The locking transaction cost 0.16 ADA, while unlocking using Halo2 verification required a fee of 2.03 ADA.</p>\n<h2>Understanding Halo2</h2>\n<p>Halo2 is a cutting-edge zk-SNARK proving system that enables secure transaction validation without revealing sensitive details.</p>\n<p>The firm explained that the technology builds upon the PLONK protocol, a universal zk-SNARK framework that optimizes efficiency and flexibility. Halo 2 is component-based, breaking up its functions into modular elements, hoping to make it easier to adapt to cryptographic needs.</p>\n<p>This approach allows one party to confirm computations to another without exposing underlying data. Unlike traditional <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/binance-adds-zk-snark-verification-to-its-proof-of-reserves-system/\">zk-SNARK</a> systems, Halo2 eliminates the need for a trusted setup and addresses potential security risks and logistical challenges.</p>\n<p>Another standout feature of Halo2 is its support for recursive proofs. This capability divides computations into smaller segments, where the proof from one stage serves as input for the next. This feature allows for efficient proof aggregation, targeting enhanced performance and scalability.</p>\n<p>Input Output stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Halo 2 was developed as an extension and improvement of the original Halo protocol, designed by Sean Bowe at Electric Coin Company. By building on modern cryptographic primitives, Halo 2 enhances the overall security of zero-knowledge proof.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>With these advancements, Halo2 aims for real-world applications to reduce overhead costs and improve the speed of proof generation and verification.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cardano-deploys-first-zero-knowledge-smart-contract-expanding-blockchain-capabilities/\">Cardano deploys first zero-knowledge smart contract, expanding blockchain capabilities</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Low-income households in the United States are turning crypto profits into opportunities for homeownership, as revealed by a Nov. 26 <a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/briefs/files/OFRBrief-24-08-crypto-exposure-and-household-financial-outcomes.pdf\">report</a> from the Office of Financial Research (OFR), a US Treasury Department research arm.</p>\n<p>Samuel Hughes, Francisco Ilabaca, Jacob Lockwood, and Kevin Zhao conducted the study based on tax data. It offers a crucial look at how crypto is shaping financial behaviors in economically vulnerable communities.</p>\n<h2>Mortgage and auto-debts</h2>\n<p>The report noted the rise of &#8220;high-crypto&#8221; areas, defined as zip codes where over 6% of households reported crypto holdings in tax filings. These regions have seen a significant uptick in mortgage and auto loan activity, coinciding with substantial <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/institutional-capital-fuels-crypto-rally-amid-profit-taking-trends-bitfinex/\">crypto market gains</a>.</p>\n<p>In these high-crypto areas, low-income households experienced a surge in mortgage activity between 2020 and 2024. The number of consumers with mortgages grew by more than 250%, while average mortgage balances jumped from $172,000 in 2020 to $443,000 in 2024, an increase of over 150%.</p>\n<p>These figures suggest that crypto windfalls have enabled many families to secure larger loans and enter the housing market.</p>\n<p>The report stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;For low-income households, average mortgage debt balances and mortgage-holding rates sharply increased in zip codes with high crypto exposure. This indicates that low-income households may be using crypto gains to take out new mortgages and to take out larger mortgages.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The report also sheds light on auto loan trends in these areas. Among low-income households, auto loan balances rose most sharply in high-crypto regions. Interestingly, while delinquency rates increased in low- and mid-crypto zip codes, they declined in high-crypto areas. This pattern suggests that crypto earnings may be helping some households manage auto loan payments more effectively.</p>\n<p>Since the 2008 banking crisis, which led to widespread defaults, single-family home ownership has never recovered. However, since Bitcoin&#8217;s inception in 2009 figures have continued to rise. While the correlation is not indicative of causation, it is interesting to note that the 2021 bull run and subsequent bear market of 2022 also saw increases and declines in new single-family homes.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_454910\" style=\"width: 1024px;\"><img alt=\"U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, New Privately-Owned Housing Units Started: Single-Family Units [HOUST1F], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST1F, November 27, 2024\" class=\"wp-image-454910 size-large\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/fredgraph-1-1024x349.png\" width=\"1024\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-454910\">U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, New Privately-Owned Housing Units Started: Single-Family Units [HOUST1F], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST1F, November 27, 2024</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Risks</h2>\n<p>Despite these positive trends, the researchers warn of potential risks tied to rising debt and leverage among low-income households with significant <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/insights/public-bitcoin-miners-underperform-btc-and-other-proxies-year-to-date/\">crypto exposure</a>.</p>\n<p>While delinquencies remain low overall, economic downturns or a slump in the crypto market could lead to financial instability. The concentration of exposure in systemically important institutions could amplify these risks.</p>\n<p>The researchers concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;An important takeaway for future monitoring is the increased debt balances and leverage among low-income households with crypto exposure. Rising distress in this group could cause future financial stress, especially if exposure to these types of high-leverage, high-risk consumers is concentrated in systemically important institutions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-windfalls-boost-homeownership-dreams-for-low-income-americans/\">Crypto windfalls boost homeownership dreams for low-income Americans</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

It alleged that it aided the laundering of over $7 billion in crypto, including stolen funds, by <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/hackers-like-lazarus-continue-to-use-tornado-cash-despite-us-sanctions/\">hacking groups linked with North Korea.</a></p>\n<h2>The judgement</h2>\n<p>On Nov. 26, the US Court of Appeals determined that the Treasury exceeded its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash&#8217;s <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/us-judge-rules-software-code-does-not-qualify-as-free-speech-in-tornado-cash-case/\">immutable smart contracts</a>. As open-source software, these contracts do not belong to any person or foreign entity and, therefore, cannot be subjected to sanctions.</p>\n<p>The court highlighted a critical 2020 event called the &#8220;trusted setup ceremony,&#8221; where over 1,000 participants contributed cryptographic data to finalize Tornado Cash&#8217;s parameters. This process rendered the smart contracts immutable, eliminating any form of updates or administrative control. Governance was later handed to the Tornado Cash community through the TORN token.</p>\n<p>The judges ruled that these contracts operate autonomously and do not meet the legal definition of property or services under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). They also pointed out that the smart contracts have <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wazirx-hacker-launders-10-million-through-tornado-cash/\">continued to operate</a> despite the OFAC&#8217;s sanction.</p>\n<p>Consequently, OFAC cannot sanction them unless Congress updates the law to account for technologies like crypto-mixing tools.</p>\n<p>The Judges <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/70EasapqSxH1kLInf3IQrd/1a1ce21cdc6bc903921f45018cce3821/Tornado_Cash.pdf\">stated</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class=\"s5\">We hold that Tornado Cash\u2019s immutable smart contracts (the lines of privacy-enabling software code) are not the &#8216;property&#8217; of a foreign national or entity, meaning they cannot be blocked under IEEPA, and OFAC overstepped its congressionally defined authority.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>Following the ruling, data from <em>CryptoSlate</em> shows that TORN surged to a two-year high of $40 before falling back to around $18, marking a 400% increase within 24 hours. Despite this rally, the token remains 96% below its all-time high of $436 recorded in February 2021.</p>\n<h2>Crypto community celebrates</h2>\n<p>The decision was widely celebrated within the crypto community., with industry leaders calling it a landmark victory for decentralized technologies and privacy rights.</p>\n<p>Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, emphasized that this ruling protects open-source software from unjust sanctions. He noted that while addressing illicit activities is essential, targeting decentralized protocols with blanket restrictions oversteps legal boundaries.</p>\n<p>He <a href=\"https://x.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1861549058797772874\">stated</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;No one wants criminals to use crypto protocols, but blocking open source technology entirely because a small portion of users are bad actors is not what Congress authorized. These sanctions stretched Treasury\u2019s authority beyond recognition, and the Fifth Circuit agreed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bill Hughes, Consensys&#8217; senior counsel and director of global regulatory matters, explained that the judgment does not mean that the rest of Tornado Cash is also out of bounds for Treasury/OFAC. However, the issue was about smart contracts with no admin key.</p>\n<p>Hughes <a href=\"https://x.com/BillHughesDC/status/1861545321450336342\">added</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;[This is] a good win. One which the Supreme Court would be unlikely to reverse. Another case where <span class=\"r-36ujnk\">Loper Bright</span> helped because the court wasn&#8217;t required to defer to a permissible reading by the agency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tornado-cash-token-surges-to-2-year-high-after-us-court-rules-treasury-sanctions-unlawful/\">Tornado Cash token surges to 2-year high after US court rules Treasury sanctions unlawful</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",
