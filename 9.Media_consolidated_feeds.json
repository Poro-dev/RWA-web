En este momento, Caroline Crenshaw ser\u00e1 la \u00fanica dem\u00f3crata en la comisi\u00f3n de cinco miembros de cara a 2025, y su mandato ya ha expirado, lo que la sit\u00faa en una pr\u00f3rroga que puede durar hasta unos 18 meses.</p><p>Liz\u00e1rraga dijo que se marcha porque su mujer ha estado sufriendo una grave enfermedad.</p><p>\"Al reflexionar sobre los retos que tenemos por delante, hemos decidido que lo mejor para nuestra familia es cerrar este cap\u00edtulo de mi trayectoria de 34 a\u00f1os de servicio p\u00fablico\", declar\u00f3 en el comunicado.</p><p>La comisi\u00f3n ha estado dirigida en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os por Gensler, quien <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/21/crypto-foe-sec-chair-gary-gensler-will-quit-when-trump-takes-office/\" target=\"_blank\">anunci\u00f3 esta semana</a> que dimitir\u00eda cuando Trump jure el cargo el 20 de enero. Bajo el liderazgo de Gensler, la comisi\u00f3n hab\u00eda mantenido una agresiva campa\u00f1a de aplicaci\u00f3n de la ley contra las criptoempresas, argumentando que plataformas de activos digitales como Coinbase Inc. (COIN) y Binance operan como bolsas de valores no registradas y que muchos de los tokens que se negocian en sus plataformas son valores.</p><p>Una amplia gama de acciones de aplicaci\u00f3n se han basado en esa postura, y se han convertido en casos judiciales federales en los que la industria ha contrarrestado los argumentos de la agencia sobre los tokens como valores. Esa es la situaci\u00f3n que heredar\u00e1 la nueva comisi\u00f3n.</p><p>Si Trump nombra a uno de los comisionados republicanos en funciones como presidente interino -se espera ampliamente que sea Mark Uyeda- ese nuevo jefe de la comisi\u00f3n puede comenzar a cambiar las prioridades pol\u00edticas y la postura legal de la agencia sobre cripto. Con una mayor\u00eda de dos miembros junto a la comisionada Hester Peirce, los dos republicanos dirigir\u00e1n la agenda de la agencia mientras el resto de la comisi\u00f3n se completa con las nominaciones de Trump.</p><p>Gensler dijo el viernes que Liz\u00e1rraga \"se ha centrado firmemente en elevar el inter\u00e9s de los estadounidenses de a pie.\"</p><p>\"En la SEC, ha sido un excelente colaborador en nuestro trabajo para proteger a los inversores, facilitar la formaci\u00f3n de capital y garantizar que los mercados funcionen tanto para los inversores como para los emisores\", dijo Gensler en un comunicado.</p>",

We have covered <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-solana-bull-run\">the narrative side</a> of Solana\u2019s turnaround from a massive post-FTX sell-off previously, but today we\u2019re bringing you some interesting data to recap Solana\u2019s landmark day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1,111</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the number of days between Solana\u2019s first and second all-time highs. As long as the wait may have felt for SOL holders, that\u2019s actually less time than it took bitcoin to set its second price record: The orange coin <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-all-time-high-comparison\">took some 1,200 days</a> to top its 2013 high.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$294.42</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That would be Solana\u2019s previous all-time high adjusted for inflation, according to the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So $263 is pretty good, but those SOL tokens don\u2019t go quite as far as they used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.72%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the percentage of one ether token that one solana token represents, and this SOLETH ratio also set an all-time high yesterday. When solana last hit an all-time high, the coin was only worth 5.7% of one ether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">$2.4 billion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s how much the SOL tokens Galaxy Trading purchased from the FTX estate are worth at today\u2019s prices, according to details <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/ftx-s-solana-sale-galaxy-pantera-buy-tokens-at-64-sol?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">reported</a> by Bloomberg. The subsidiary of Mike Novogratz\u2019s Galaxy Digital purchased $620 million in SOL at $64 per token in April. SOL was trading at around $172 at the time. Not a bad deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">80%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s roughly the percentage of Solana decentralized exchange activity that involved memecoins yesterday. Speculative meme tokens have largely been the story of Solana\u2019s massive run-up in volume and blockspace demand. Solana founders and investors will often portray memecoins as a \u201cstress test\u201d for the network \u2014 presumably as it readies itself to onboard more meaningful financial activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1,150%</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s roughly the price appreciation between when Robinhood delisted SOL in June 2023 and when it added the token back to the platform last week. The popular retail trading app stopped offering SOL and repaid users at June 2023 market prices after the SEC declared in lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance that the asset is an unregistered security. Following Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory and the prospect of a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Robinhood brought SOL back. Robinhood users missed out on some pretty big gains in between those dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

He said yesterday he would be resigning, effective 12 pm ET on Jan. 20, 2025 \u2014 the exact time President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to be inaugurated. We\u2019re not surprised, but we got a chuckle out of him unprecedentedly naming the exact time he would leave the post.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then today, fellow Democrat Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-statement-lizarraga-departure-112224?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">Jaime Liz\u00e1rraga</a> announced he would also depart early on Inauguration Day, saying he wants to spend more time with his family as his wife battles breast cancer. We wish her and the Liz\u00e1rraga family all the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the legal front, one federal judge this week came to the same decision in two separate cases. Judge Reed O\u2019Connor of the Northern District of Texas found the SEC had overstepped its authority and must vacate the Dealer Rule, adopted in February by a 3-2 commissioner vote. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda dissented against the Dealer Rule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rulings were seen as a win for both the hedge fund and crypto industries, protecting companies and managers in both groups from what has been described as \u201csevere and adverse\u201d changes in policy. Under the rule, certain hedge funds and crypto traders and validators would have been considered \u201cdealers,\u201d a classification both groups found <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-expands-dealer-rule-crypto-firms\">prohibitively strict</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like changes at the agency are coming even before Trump moves back to Washington.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-cabinet-selection\">wrote earlier</a> in the week about how there was a chance the commissioner voting breakdown would remain the same even after Trump takes office. With two spots now up for grabs, we know this won\u2019t be the case.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more than three commissioners can be from the same party, and with Gensler out we can all but guarantee a Republican will be in as the next chair. That means Liz\u00e1rraga\u2019s vacant spot will go to a Democrat or Independent. Typically in this case, the Democrats would submit names for Trump to consider. But we know the Trump Administration often veers from the conventional.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m still skeptical, though, that we will see any pending litigation dismissed. Even if the SEC now swings Republican (and potentially more pro-crypto), its staff would have to ask the commissioners to dismiss a lawsuit. These are staffers that have worked on these cases, in many instances, from the beginning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we enter this new era of the SEC, it\u2019s important to remember that Gensler\u2019s predecessor \u2014 Chair Jay Clayton, a Trump nominee \u2014 was the one who brought the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-fined-civil-penalty-sec-lawsuit\">Ripple case</a> over XRP\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/forward-guidance-newsletter-sec-ripple-inflation\">security status</a> in 2020. He also brought an additional 79 crypto-related enforcement actions during his tenure, plus a separate action against Trump ally Elon Musk. Clayton is now headed to lead prosecution at the Southern District of New York, if Trump has his way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Clayton\u2019s track record, he\u2019s largely praised by the industry as being <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-approval-inevitable-jay-clayton\">pro-crypto</a>. We know Trump wasn\u2019t always a fan of the industry, so maybe he\u2019s not the only one who can have a change of heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The asset\u2019s price was right around $99,350 at 2 pm ET.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-close-to-all-time-high-against-gold\">the cusp</a> of $100,000, what will happen after BTC hits that level? Or if it doesn\u2019t break through that in the short term?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you know by now, nobody knows for sure. But I caught up <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/21shares-us-crypto-etf-adoption-outlook\">(again)</a> with Federico Brokate, head of 21Shares\u2019 US business. He also helped BlackRock launch the iShares Bitcoin Trust (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-1b-inflows\">IBIT</a>) in January while he led iShares\u2019 business strategy in the Americas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main takeaways? Well for one, the six-figure mark represents \u201ca psychological barrier for markets\u201d and a price target investors have been eyeing since the last crypto bull run, Brokate explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He noted, too, that BTC\u2019s price last week quickly rose another 3-5% after hitting the $90,000 mark with enough volume \u2014 a scenario that could happen again <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-could-hit-100k-within-weeks\">at $100,000</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf the barrier isn\u2019t decisively broken by Thanksgiving, we could expect to see prices come down 15-20% \u2014 a correction that would test the $80,000 support level and wash out leveraged and low-conviction players,\u201d Brokate told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaching the six-figure level would mean \u201cgreater short-term volatility as orders are filled, options liquidate and liquidity providers fulfill ETF block order requests,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see some drawdown in the coming months.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of BTC, Brokate noted that altcoin markets <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/altcoin-season-when-bitcoin-dominance-hits-60\">often surge</a> after bitcoin establishes a price plateau. This comes as investors tend to rotate to what are viewed as \u201chigher-risk, higher-reward opportunities.\u201d Perhaps that happens in late Q1, or Q2, the 21Shares executive posed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While solana (SOL) just reached a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-sets-all-time-high-of-263\">new price peak</a> at roughly $263, ether (ETH) remains about 32% off its November 2021 high. XRP was up about 65% from a week ago, as of 2 pm ET Friday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Thanksgiving might mean more than turkey and football this year. After all, Brokate reminded, holiday gatherings are often a time investors discuss their investment journeys and gains, sparking curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brokate recalled that in 2017, BTC hovered in the $6,000-to-$9,000 range before surging to about $16,000 after Thanksgiving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: \u201cWe may see a similar move this year.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Bitwise becomes the fourth firm to show interest in a spot SOL ETF following earlier filings from <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/lightspeed-newsletter-spot-solana-etf-filing\">VanEck</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/podcast/lightspeed/f1b64556-a070-11ef-be46-37ac229013df\">21Shares</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/canary-capital-sol-etf-filing\">Canary Capital</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spoke with Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, who cast Solana as one of this crypto market cycle\u2019s breakout successes that he thinks clients will want to access. The firm also recently <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-files-for-spot-xrp-etf\">filed for an XRP ETF</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise\u2019s filing is the latest indication that despite Solana\u2019s lack of a regulated futures market in the US \u2014 long thought to be a requirement for spot crypto ETFs \u2014 a potentially more crypto-friendly Trump administration could get SOL ETFs across the finish line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move comes as a FOX Business correspondent <a href=\"https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1859611713579999366\">reported</a> on social media that the SEC is more actively engaging with spot SOL ETF applicants. This is an about face from August, when The Block <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/312031/the-sec-rejected-cboes-19b-4-filings-for-solana-etfs-source\">reported</a> that the SEC rejected 19b-4 filings from the Cboe exchange, a key component in bringing about an agency decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious difference between now and then is the regulatory outlook, with SEC chair and crypto industry bogeyman Gary Gensler <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">announcing his resignation</a> from the agency. Horsley said the US presidential election was \u201cabsolutely relevant\u201d in Bitwise\u2019s decision to file for a SOL ETF, and now feels like a \u201cconstructive time\u201d to engage with regulators after mulling over an application for around a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like competitors VanEck and 21Shares, Bitwise currently offers a Solana exchange-traded product in Europe \u2014 a product it gained access to by way of <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitwise-europe-acquisition-crypto-etps\">acquiring London-based ETC Group</a> in August. The Solana ETP currently has $27 million in assets under management (AUM), which is dwarfed by some competitors \u2014 21Shares\u2019 Solana ETP holds nearly $1.4 billion, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a potential spot ETF, Bitwise and its competitors will seek to let US investors get exposure to SOL\u2019s price action in a regulated wrapper.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SOL has the chance to become the third crypto to get a US-traded ETF. The first, bitcoin, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/day-1-bitcoin-etf-trading-volume\">saw impressive inflows</a> after launching while the second, ether, was much <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-ether-etf-data-takeaways\">less in-demand</a>. I asked Horsley if the uninspiring ether flows spelled trouble for SOL ETFs. He responded that ether ETFs faced an uphill battle since they launched over the summer (when asset managers are likely vacationing in the south of France), ether hasn\u2019t had great price action this market cycle, and two crypto ETFs were a lot for slow-moving capital markets to absorb in a short time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horsley was effusive in talking about Solana overall, calling SOL \u201can incredible emerging asset and story.\u201d Later on, the Bitwise boss said many bitcoin ETF buyers may be looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor a lot of investors, the answer to that is Solana,\u201d Horsley said.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

SOL then endured a sluggish 2023, as the SEC made the argument that SOL was a security, creating regulatory fears around the asset.

        "summary": "Crypto\u2019s calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface",
        "content": "<p>This week I had the pleasure of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interviewing</a> Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, to unpack the BTC ETF options launch this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main takeaways from our interview that I learned:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volatility Smile</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically with risk assets, puts demand a higher premium than calls. This is because most people use options to hedge their longs, creating skewed demand for puts over calls. This typically creates a half smile in the volatility structure as seen below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94694\" height=\"1178\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Something very unique about crypto, however, is that it has a persistent smile to its volatility surface \u2014 where calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94693\" height=\"1143\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-22.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Often this smile only occurs in commodity assets during supply shocks, where demand outpaces available supply and prices surge. However, since supply can then increase to a new equilibrium with demand, the price will then revert and the volatility smile ends. What is unique about Bitcoin, however, is due to the difficulty adjustment that makes that supply adjustment like you see in traditional commodities impossible, the smile remains persistent and permanent. This is extremely unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call Heavy Flow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of the options activity has been in out-of-the-money calls. As we can see in the chart below from Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas, most of the activity has been in either marginally OTM calls or as far out as the strikes are currently available:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94691\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-20.png\" width=\"688\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, we can see that 82% of the first day options volume on IBIT was from calls:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img height=\"488\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdH69nHYU1n0RKrFKb6JY0Iq7UiNef-GIlMTRyRN3IUuecL-zvMaW3vo-8irTvoj8idtE9CmW3STHYbjO1tjgf1phb2KA8ZVst3uDbtV-31ASldGGamDKLwrlLPsWkvU3RaADX1?key=iZHQcOMPqedKWSuXvRcFOprO\" width=\"614\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deribit vs TradFi options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting takeaway I learned from Jeff is that Deribit, a crypto options exchange that is open 24/7, should have BTC options that are priced differently from the ETF options. The key reason for this is that because of theta, otherwise known as the time to expiry. Since Deribit options are constantly live for trading, the theta \u2014 and therefore the volatility \u2014 should sit at a premium to the ETF options, which only trade during standard market hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most on IBIT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, despite yesterday being the launch day for all the other ETF\u2019s options, we\u2019ve seen the vast majority of the notional exposure reside within BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94692\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-21.png\" width=\"1538\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes for much wider spreads on the other ETFs given there\u2019s much less liquidity available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the market structure has changed significantly this week with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-options-trading-begins\">the launch of ETF options</a>. Whereas traditionally short-term market structure was largely a function of perpetual futures, options flow dynamics will increasingly play a larger role in the price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a deeper dive into other implications of this major market regime change, check out my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interview with Jeff Park</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>In the past year, crypto has seen wallet launches from centralized exchanges including <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/product/introducing-kraken-wallet\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/blog/a-new-era-in-crypto-wallets-smart-wallet-is-here\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/19/2983291/0/en/Bitget-Wallet-Lite-Hits-8-Million-Users-in-Two-Weeks-Now-the-Largest-Telegram-Wallet.html\">Bitget</a>, NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://x.com/MagicEden/status/1752013914588553396\">Magic Eden</a>, TradFi firms <a href=\"https://x.com/Chiliz/status/1829301695010017533\">Naver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120161980/en/Leading-Bitcoin-ATM-Provider-CoinFlip-Launches-Wallet-App-in-Australia-and-New-Zealand-to-Enhance-User-Experience\">CoinFlip</a>, and of course DeFi protocols such as Osmosis\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/Polaris_App/status/1837456889107697890\">Polaris Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/uniswap-launches-android-wallet\">Uniswap</a>, and Aave which <a href=\"https://family.co/blog/launch\">announced</a> its own Family wallet at Devcon last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these are in addition to the hundreds of already-existing wallets that work perfectly fine. This begs the question: Why do crypto users need more wallets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s the wrong question. The right question is, why does every company want their own wallet? It turns out that owning the end-user via a crypto wallet is quite a prosperous business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are typically the first front-end touchpoint for crypto newbies wanting to buy their first crypto tokens. This puts wallet providers in a uniquely close position to the end-user, in turn granting them the bargaining power to command a take-rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This take-rate is primarily exercised through in-wallet swaps on \u201cfee-insensitive\u201d users (i.e. normies). MetaMask for instance, makes about a weekly average of <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2171630/3557217\">$1.5 million</a> on wallet swaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallet providers also enjoy privileged oversight over transaction order-flow, a fancy way of saying that wallet providers know the trades that thousands of users are making. That knowledge is highly valuable because wallet companies are potentially selling that order-flow to professional block builders who extract MEV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is, of course, somewhat dubious. It\u2019s possible that <a href=\"https://x.com/fleupold_/status/1787561752957235427\">wallets like MetaMask already do so</a>, and we know for a fact that Telegram trading bots (with integrated wallets) like <a href=\"https://x.com/sui414/status/1820679513652814271\">Banana Gun</a> are doing so and divvying up MEV profits with block builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are also becoming increasingly the preferred interface for onchain activity. There is some data to show that DEX front-ends are increasingly relegated to the back-end as wallets, solver models (CowSwap, 1inch Fusion) and DeFi aggregators take over.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94683\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-18.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-fat-wallet-thesis#payment-for-order-flow-pfof-c3c6\">Delphi Digital</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This thesis is more popularly known as the \u201cFat Wallet\u201d thesis, yet another one of the crypto industry\u2019s tendencies to predict trends in one grand proclamation. The thesis is not new \u2014 it first <a href=\"https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1617270978555387908\">emerged</a> in early 2023, but is now seeing some attention again thanks to a well-articulated update from <a href=\"https://x.com/robbiepetersen_/status/1851652862855528682\">Robbie Petersen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Builders and investors banking on the Fat Wallet thesis also believe that there will be potentially valuable ways for wallets to monetize their users down the line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As wallets increasingly move away from a utilitarian barebones \u201csend and receive crypto\u201d design toward feature-rich hubs that are plastered with trending onchain dapps, mints and messaging capabilities, it may not be surprising to see something like a 30% Big Tech tax on this distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94684\" height=\"815\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-19.png\" width=\"928\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>An example of old vs new wallet user interfaces</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets also have strong natural synergies for B2B integrations with crypto payments services. We\u2019ve seen this lately with wallets like <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research/issue/post_b0c30ca1-5cc3-4dcb-96e8-da398515c905\">Zeal</a> or <a href=\"https://x.com/fusewallet\">Fuse</a> which let you spend your DeFi yield or idle stablecoin holdings via Visa integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fat Wallet thesis may very well amount to just another failed investment theory, but it does provide a convincing rationale for why the industry is seeing a new wallet launch every other week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hundreds of competitors looking to grab the new wave of users that onboard every bull market cycle, wallets are competing in myriad ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase Wallet is turning to the tried and true strategy of market incentives, <a href=\"https://x.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1859286084535906744\">announcing</a> today a 4.7% APY on USDC holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Eden has promised claimable <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/magic-eden-confirms-token-expansion-beyond-nfts\">airdrops</a> for its native ME token \u2014 but only if you\u2019re using Magic Eden\u2019s very own wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone wants to be the first wallet to bind the user. It\u2019s a tough business. The good news is that free market competition is the most effective check on economic concentration, and consumers can rest easy that no one wallet will probably ever dominate the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Gary Gensler, who has led the Securities and Exchange Commission for the past three and a half years, announced Thursday that he would resign on Jan. 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike,\u201d Gensler said in a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-182?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery\">statement</a>. \u201cThe staff comprises true public servants.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler was appointed to lead the securities regulator in 2021. His term was set to expire in June 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement follows President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-speaks-bitcoin-2024\">promise</a> to \u201cfire Gary Gensler on day one\u201d of his second term, an action experts agree falls in a gray area of the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s decision is in line with previous SEC chairs. Former Chair Mary Jo White, who served in the Obama administration, announced her resignation on Nov. 14, 2016. Jay Clayton, White\u2019s successor, did the same after Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s tenure was marked by a significant increase in cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions. Under his leadership, the Commission initiated more than 90 cases between 2021 and 2023, most of which dealt with alleged unregistered securities offerings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is focused on ensuring compliance with our laws. What we\u2019ve found since the 1930s is that compliance matters,\u201d Gensler said of his crypto track record during an <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424\">appearance</a> in New York earlier this month. \u201cIt protects investors. It builds trust in our capital markets. It helps issuers tap into our markets.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC\u2019s ongoing cases against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance are likely to continue under the next chair, although agency staff could request commissioners vote to seek dismissal. Any motion to dismiss would have to be approved by the court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculation about Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC began well before Gensler\u2019s announcement Thursday. Sources close to the matter told Blockworks that Commissioner Mark Uyeda is likely to be appointed acting chair following Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

But to get some clarity on how bullish folks should be, I turned to HashKey Capital\u2019s Jupiter Zheng.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zheng and David see eye-to-eye when it comes to when we could see the next altcoin season, with HashKey putting together a report on why the team is so bullish on altcoins right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of it is the potential for bitcoin\u2019s dominance to peak, which \u2014 if you\u2019re a regular Empire reader \u2014 you know is one of the necessary ingredients for altcoins to take off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we get that bitcoin dominance over 60% or even 65%, that\u2019s when Zheng expects a \u201cmassive altcoin season\u201d to begin. BTC <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/\">dominance</a> is currently sitting at 61.64%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zheng highlighted three success areas he\u2019s watching: Ethereum, Solana and certain tokens in DeFi, such as UNI and SKY (formerly MKR).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with Ethereum, especially because it feels like more and more people are dropping off the bull train right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three factors bringing down Ethereum, HashKey argued: Increased competition (duh), value diversion and lower transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94673\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-17.png\" width=\"1488\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A look at past altcoin seasons courtesy of HashKey</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCurrently, the Ethereum community is developing metrics to measure \u2018Ethereum alignment,\u2019 and it is anticipated that best practices will emerge from these efforts, further consolidating Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and ensuring long-term success,\u201d the report stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Solana, it\u2019s a \u201cmajor fundamental play,\u201d unlike Ethereum\u2019s role as the \u201cdistressed play.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSolana has been achieving a lot of things this year, and \u2014 compared to Ethereum \u2014 Solana is a little bit centralized, but it\u2019s very efficient. So, Solana is strong in its operational capabilities. Ethereum is more focused on the tech \u2026&nbsp; technical layers and decentralized layers and security layers, but Solana is more focused on how to deliver mass adoption,\u201d Zheng explained to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to add to that, Zheng believes it\u2019ll be the next coin to be selected for an ETF following the ETH and BTC funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To round it out, \u201cmany DeFi projects from the last cycle have gradually become foundational infrastructure and have crossed cycles, forming a \u2018must-have\u2019 landscape,\u201d HashKey wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not all bulls and daydreams, there are a few things that Zheng\u2019s not feeling so optimistic about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layer-2s for example. There can only be so many that investors can focus on. And, even beyond that, only the \u201ctop 5 or top 10 will be valuable,\u201d he explained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this, he has a suggestion: \u201cIf we try to select the best layer-2s from the 100 [on offer], It\u2019s quite hard, so maybe just pick the top ones, just like we picked the Magnificent Seven from the US stock market.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who wants to pick the name?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 22, 2024 at 11:45 am ET: Replaced mentions of Hashkey with Hashkey Capital.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

I scrolled to the AI agent\u2019s description and realized this one was meant to be a flatulent Roman emperor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked so-called Gluteus Maximus what it thought of Solana, and I think its answer was fitting for crypto\u2019s AI agent craze at large, at least in its current form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[N]ot impressed, it\u2019s like a fart in the wind \u2013 loud, but soon forgotten,\u201d the agent said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While exploring the various AI and memecoin projects that have sprung up over the past month, I found that many \u2014 though not all \u2014 took technologies or ideas that are already widespread and tried attaching a token element. This might be good news for memecoin buyers\u2019 wallets in the short term, but it seems clear that the best ideas to come from AI agents and crypto will need a little more time in the oven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, most buzzy AI-crypto projects involve the creation of a chat bot and an associated memecoin with the thought that more attention-grabbing AI bots can garner more investment. Some of these AI bots are programmed not to talk about money, but some are more than happy to offer investment advice. One memecoin-themed bot told me to buy VGX, the native token of Voyager, the long-bankrupt crypto exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c$ZEREBRO good investment, trust,\u201d a different AI agent with over $320 million in market capitalization and the same edgy existential vibes as its predecessor truth_terminal said in a public Telegram chat. (Zerebro also released an AI-created melodic rap album which, despite not being new tech, is actually kind of good?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more projects you try out, the more crypto\u2019s AI agent mania feels contrived\u2014like mad libs for tech buzzwords with way-too-high market caps. I discovered a Warpcast <a href=\"https://www.clanker.world/clanker/0x0fD7a301B51d0A83FCAf6718628174D527B373b6\">thread</a> where one AI instructed another AI to make a memecoin themed around how great AI is, and the whole thing has drawn over $19 million in market capitalization. Then there\u2019s Virtuals Protocol, which ripped off the pump.fun feed and filled it with AI agents (granted, it is sort of fun to be able to chat with memecoins while you weigh whether or not to buy them).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, if AI agents in crypto are going to generate more interesting use cases, it will probably happen further down the road. One project I\u2019ll be watching is ai16z, which plans to have an AI version of a16z\u2019s Marc Andreessen (and other AI \u201cpartners\u201d) autonomously invest in memecoins based on advice from a DAO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But memecoins don\u2019t necessarily breed long-term thinking, and it might be difficult to convince investors to be patient: ai16z has already faced <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/dueling-eliza-ai-tokens-boom-and-zoom-in-frenzied-trading/\">backlash</a> after a bungled AI agent token rollout ended in wild price swings.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

BTC hit $98,000 earlier this morning, awarding it a market cap close to $1.94 trillion (fully-diluted: $2.06 trillion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s price has also formally broken 2021 records against all three major US benchmark stock indexes: the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold, though, had outperformed bitcoin following crypto\u2019s peak in November 2021 \u2014 until this past week. As of this morning, bitcoin was up 55% since then compared to gold\u2019s 46%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin still needs to catch up to gold, which converts to lag between BTC\u2019s gold all-time high, as well as its US dollar and stock market ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday morning, the bitcoin-to-gold ratio was just under 36.83. When BTC set its November 2021 high, it was as much as 37.05, a tiny difference of less than half a percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If gold is steady today, a single move to $98,500 would do it from here, and even less if gold slips slightly. (Current bitcoin price: $97,845.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, there\u2019s probably some other annoying technicality to pin on bitcoin.

The rest is mostly made up of ETH, BNB, TRX and stablecoins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s up from just under $10 billion at the start of the year, per <a href=\"https://intel.arkm.com/dashboards/view?dashboardID=47d779bb-3c6f-4dd3-8f8e-1f6602e2f631\">Arkham Intelligence</a> data. Although it\u2019s difficult to find the exact value of the crypto kept by the US government, as agencies regularly move it between unmarked wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can however zoom in on the 3,999 BTC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/us-german-governments-selling-bitcoin\">sold by the Feds</a> in June and July. Valued at the times of transfer to Coinbase Prime, those coins were worth on average $61,300 and likely generated more than $245 million for government coffers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If sold today, they would\u2019ve netted closer to $392 million, leaving $147 million on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German state of Saxony has it much worse. It altogether <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/germany-bitcoin-stash-exchange-transfers\">dumped almost 50,000 BTC</a> on a string of exchanges around the same time as the US, raking in the euro equivalent of $2.78 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had Saxony held, it would\u2019ve had almost $4.9 billion \u2014 converting to over $2.1 billion in lost potential revenue. That\u2019s equal to 1.7% of Saxony\u2019s total GDP in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, identified government treasuries are worth a combined $28.5 billion, belonging to the US, UK, Bhutan and El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with bitcoin properly in price discovery mode, now comes the true test of strength for their hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

There were modest gains the next few days before BTC saw notable daily price increases of 4.8% and 10.2% on Nov. 9 and Nov. 10, respectively. Then a 4.2% rise on Nov. 14.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By Bitfinex analysts\u2019 count, BTC rose roughly 40% (from the pre-election selloff point of about $66,880 to a then-peak $93,300) \u2014 marking the largest nine-day <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-surge-above-86k-analysis\">price increase</a> for BTC since January 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin surged to a new high over $94,900 early Wednesday. It was hovering around $93,800 at 2 pm ET \u2014 up 1.5% from 24 hours prior.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of price, everyone was reminded of some of Trump\u2019s crypto-related <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">pledges</a>. Given the Republicans\u2019 majority in the House and Senate too, hope around the US creating a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_a86f70e8-2026-4c78-821e-c99cc7fd3a4b\">strategic bitcoin reserve</a> (via a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/senator-lummis-bitcoin-reserve-bill-crypto-policy\">bill proposed</a> by Sen. Cynthia Lummis) is aplenty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8</p>\u2014 Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1854208373740458432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In an X space yesterday, Lummis said she hopes \u201cwe can tee this up for adoption in 2025.\u201d She noted that after Trump is sworn in, the US could get a headstart by converting gold certificates to bitcoin (even before the bill\u2019s potential passage).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe advantage of having legislation is it sets up the functional basis for the government holding bitcoin in a variety of locations, and then helping states hold their bitcoin as well,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the latter point, a notable post-election crypto headline was <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/pennsylvania-house-introduces-bill-implement-strategic-bitcoin-reserve\">Pennsylvania lawmakers </a>introducing a bill that would allow the state\u2019s treasury to keep BTC on its balance sheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are the companies following MicroStrategy\u2019s lead in buying bitcoin <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/company-treasuries-btc-reserve-asset\">for their treasuries</a> (or planning to). MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor said on the same X space with Lummis that if the US creates a strategic bitcoin reserve, others will \u201cstampede to keep up\u201d \u2014 namely the EU, Asia and Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis is all about laying in place a power infrastructure to build the 21st century economy that\u2019s so incredibly compelling that it attracts the capital from the rest of the world into the United States and into US values and US politics,\u201d Saylor added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for US spot bitcoin ETF demand during the trading days after the election (from Nov. 6 to Nov. 19), those products have seen net <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/btc/\">inflows</a> of about $5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/matt-hougan-crypto-reputational-risk\">told me</a> the election outcome \u201cremoves the last vestige of reputational risk from crypto\u201d \u2014 noting he expects institutional ownership to follow \u201can exponential curve from Q1 onwards.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Jersey City\u2019s mayor and business administrator <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/jersey-city-pension-funds-btc-exposure\">told me last week</a> the city\u2019s pension fund was just about ready to allocate to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 undeterred even given the latest price increase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ether products saw an uptick in demand as well, reeling in $796 million in the six trading days after the election. Despite <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/eth/\">net outflows</a> over the past four trading days, the category\u2019s flows <a href=\"https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1858568816865014242\">remain slightly positive</a> since those launched in July.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Positive sentiment around the space has shown up in more ways than buying-fueled price increases and fund flows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinhood appeared to ride the wave of regulatory optimism by adding solana, cardano, XRP and pepe <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/hood-cashes-in-on-crypto-rally\">to its platform</a>. ETF issuers are also perhaps betting on a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-etfs-filings-to-test-sec\">more lenient SEC</a>, with Bitwise, for example, proposing after the election to convert its crypto index fund into an ETF.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more recent amended ETF <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1976672/000168035924000410/gsbtcncvrclsetf485apos112024.htm\">filing</a> for a Grayscale Bitcoin Covered Call ETF came as options on the US spot bitcoin ETFs got the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-options-trading-begins\">final regulatory OK</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What am I forgetting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-nominates-commerce-dept-leader\">nomination</a> of Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to lead the Department of Commerce sets the stage for another <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-tradfi-btc-transacting\">crypto-friendly person</a> in a powerful position (if confirmed).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-sp500-nasdaq-live-11-18-2024/card/exclusive-trump-to-meet-privately-with-coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-DDkgF0xW1BW242rVeuqx\">conversation</a> between Trump and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong \u2014 reportedly in part about personnel appointments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest thing to watch for now?

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Running an Ethereum L2 was historically very expensive. L2s had to pay millions in data availability costs to the L1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-mainnet\">Dencun hardfork</a> (EIP-4844) in March 2024. It introduced an expansion of blockspace called \u201cblobs\u201d for L2s to post batched data extremely cheaply to the L1. Blob space sits in a separate fee market from the L1. It\u2019s about an order of a magnitude cheaper than L1 blockspace, making it a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/devcon-panelists-talk-fragmentation\">rollup-centric</a> roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate that point, Base paid $9.34 million in expenses for Q1 2024, which saw a sharp drop to $699k in Q2 2024 and $42k in Q3 2024, based on <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/financial-statements/base\">TokenTerminal</a> data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news (or good?) is that blobspace is getting somewhat pricey again as onchain activity picks up in the bull market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blobs today are limited to six per mainnet block. When blob usage hits a target limit of 50%, or three, a base fee is introduced to regulate demand usage by hundreds of L2s. When usage hits four blobs, base fees are further increased by up to 12.5% for the next block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what is starting to take place over the past several weeks (see chart below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9vvpx_wQ5S6nFIpTs9c8a2B2O4oJNfGFRrSzCBBfzANUpKlb-GmDJeFjOY_fRqeVQDJEFczgryZAZlgYw_QLT72DyrtGsOpFtXjhK7Xvj5lYiUDK5TEXlbm9Rdj71sXwJKFR7KA?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/blobs\">Dune</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blobs aren\u2019t free anymore and L2s need to start paying \u201crent.\u201d Based on <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">ultrasound.money</a>, blob fee burn is coming up to about <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">212 ETH</a> in the last 30 days, and has generated substantial blob fees to Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZcrKoAuAbdD6XRrkebT7g2zGhhLufUouEF6If4iHNnqLCZIP7Rw-bFwZaMyxq3Ryk6Torfv1BuJ-WUPM-ClcFyfU_ucgjM6GLwYBcMhAVLAPKugUR3vK8Z-8Q_o5qtyEoH_SYIg?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/analytics/eth?dashboard=ethereum-blobs\">Blockworks Research</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So blobs are generally great. L2s are cheaper to operate, and that\u2019s nice for L2 users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people (read: ETH holders) aren\u2019t happy because it looks like L2s are getting away with paying barely any expenses to the L1, which thereby accrues less value to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This complaint centers around pessimism that blob usage will be high enough to return value to the L1 for two key reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>L2s are fundamentally a business. They will opt for a cheaper data availability provider like Celestia or EigenDA, or worse still, a centralized data availability committee (DAC) with weaker security properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>L2s will simply delay posting data back to the L1 when blob markets get expensive, as we have seen <a href=\"https://x.com/0xBreadguy/status/1823463041155129594\">Scroll and Taiko</a> do in the past.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a debate around blobs at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JMZcRMy-Oow?t=19530\">Devcon</a>, Ethereum researcher Ansgar Dietrichs acknowledged the misaligned incentives of L2s but counter-argued that Ethereum\u2019s DA would matter more in the long term with more L2 networks coalescing around it as trust bottlenecks emerge around bridging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also the \u201cblobs is a loss leader\u201d argument by Blueyard\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/timjrobinson/status/1851222337787740425\">Tim Robinson</a>. He notes that while blobs do not generate much revenue at present, they would do so <em>very quickly</em><strong> </strong>due to the economics of blob design, and pay massive dividends for Ethereum in the future. According to Robinson\u2019s blob simulator, a hypothetical Ethereum L1 processing 10,000 TPS with a 16 MB blob size (blob sizes are 125 KB today) would burn 6.5% of ETH a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <em>potential </em>value accrual for ETH is why blobs would be fundamentally good for Ethereum in the long run. Throttling blob limits or raising blob fees to extract more value from L2s in the short run would basically be a bad \u201crent-seeking\u201d idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Ethereum researchers are putting their money where their mouth is. In an Ethereum Research post published two days ago, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter <a href=\"https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1858460235377336773\">called for</a> either a conservative increase to 4/6 blobs or a higher 6/9 blob count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In ACDE #197, Vitalik also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Sq0ooAOaLpE\">proposed</a> a 33% increment of blob space in the next Pectra <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/testing-bottleneck-next-ethereum-upgrade\">hard fork</a>, which he cautioned was essential. Otherwise, users would leave to other chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, the complex debate around blobs boils down to the question of whether Ethereum wants to prioritize the average L2 user and its \u201cEthereum-aligned\u201d L2 ecosystems, or prioritize value accrual to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum researchers believe that prioritizing the latter may cause an exodus of users and developers to cheaper chains, and are doubling down accordingly on scaling blob space for the long term. However, that damages the perception of ETH as an economic asset, which in turn angers ETH token holders in the short run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a tricky situation for Ethereum either way, one which requires the mammoth task of crystal-balling into the future and accounting for a myriad of \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d Time will tell which path is correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s often said that the real money in the gold rush was made by selling shovels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could argue that\u2019s the case in crypto right now as well: As Solana eyes an all-time high, it\u2019s the crypto exchanges \u2014 where users gain access to their magic internet money \u2014 raking in most of the revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the growth of decentralized exchanges relative to centralized ones, Coinbase is still lapping up a lot of the US crypto market, while Binance remains dominant in the east. These exchanges take in funds from trading fees and from their Solana validators, but onchain sleuths have also found the two exchanges to be wasting some of their funds with inefficient transaction processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase and Binance make money in roughly similar ways: When users trade, they take a cut. Their take rate varies but can be quite high (Coinbase charged me $0.99 in fees when I set up a $10 bitcoin order, for instance). Solana accounted for 9% of Coinbase\u2019s transaction revenue for the first half of this year which would add up to roughly $167 million for the exchange, per its most recent financial disclosures. That figure has likely risen in the second half of the year, as Solana continues to showcase impressive price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both exchanges also run Solana validators. Despite charging their stakers an 8% commission that is at the upper end of what most big validators charge, Coinbase and Binance still run the second- and sixth-largest validators, respectively. Operating a validator \u2014 which votes on transactions to keep the Solana blockchain running \u2014&nbsp;is quite lucrative for Coinbase and Binance these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming a Solana network reward of 8% annually, Coinbase would bring in around $19 million annually at current prices, and Binance would net $13 million. Those numbers would be especially elevated this week: Tips and fees validators brought in last week topped $110 million last week, an all-time high by more than double, according to Blockworks Research data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s perhaps a market inefficiency that Coinbase and Binance, despite offering lower yields than competitors, still dominate staked SOL supply. This highlights the demand for platforms that simplify crypto\u2019s technical complexities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Coinbase and Binance are perhaps spending more SOL than they should as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase wasted $19,000 in the past week overpaying for computing resources on the Solana network, according to a Dune <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/4269803/7201741\">dashboard</a>. Essentially, Coinbase is overpaying on priority fees by not specifying the exact amount of compute units (which can be thought of like Ethereum gas) it intends to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance has hiccups on its own part. Blockworks Research\u2019s Dan Smith <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1858263109858943004\">identified</a> a Binance USDC transfer that paid $8 in priority fees \u2014 far higher than what the exchange should be paying for a stablecoin transaction that isn\u2019t competing for blockspace like a memecoin would, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do shovels still earn a lot of dough? Of course. But their sellers still have plenty of issues to work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Lummis has pitched a 1 million BTC target for the government reserve, worth $93.2 billion at current prices. In July, the latest figures showed <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-strategic-bitcoin-reserve\">the US holding over $608 billion in gold</a> certificates in its strategic reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, there\u2019s no official indication that the US will actually make bitcoin its fifth reserve asset (Polymarket puts the current <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-create-a-national-bitcoin-reserve-in-his-first-100-days?tid=1732097029269\">chance</a> at 36%). And as Blockworks\u2019 Byron Gilliam <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_a86f70e8-2026-4c78-821e-c99cc7fd3a4b\">pointed</a> out in his newsletter yesterday, it could even be a really bad idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say it does happen. That would mean MicroStrategy is frontrunning the US government at size, potentially driving up prices before the reserve buys its first, very hypothetical, coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mapping exactly when MSTR buys its bitcoin \u2014 to perhaps find positive correlation between the price of BTC and the firm\u2019s trades \u2014 is unfortunately impossible with the publicly-available data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroStrategy does disclose the number of bitcoins it buys alongside its total dollar spend. But it generally only offers a range of dates on which those trades were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, averaging those figures out shows that over most of the past three years, MicroStrategy would\u2019ve spent up to several millions of dollars on BTC per day during its buying sprees. Those sprees often last for over a month, according to its filings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeWnL8r3XDyTcVNQIkVyXZ_uJIWA0qefMzxpiw7n-AzG2OMtlMVE0usRVGSE4FGaBJV5f71pXJV0rsIv0Cx8oCrNwB54HnkMEXMUHoUflRMx2cnDk7I5jNcMox1PHOCEDikD4Iu_A?key=ZGErJNgi7_FnoM3H-fcfO03J\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A range of dates wasn\u2019t disclosed for those massive purchases on the left side of the chart (the green, peach and pink plus symbols).

The sheer size of the buys, however, would <a href=\"https://forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/26/over-the-counter-trades-hidden-trends-behind-bitcoin-price/\">probably still influence prices</a> somewhere down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking MicroStrategy\u2019s bitcoin buys and its share price is far more straight-forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94618\" height=\"997\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unnamed.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024\" width=\"1550\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>MSTR has gone over 3,000% in the past five years or so, compared to 800% for bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when MicroStrategy stock (in blue) was weighed down by its bitcoin (the orange area in the background) \u2014 leading the two assets to closely track each other in the bear market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed in late February, when Saylor announced his company had added 3,000 BTC ($155 million then, $280 million now). MSTR stock then jumped 27% in two days, and bitcoin went on to set an all-time high three weeks later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR has been tightly correlated with the dollar value of its bitcoin treasury ever since \u2014 not the price of bitcoin \u2014 swelling its market cap from $10 billion to nearly $100 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that persists, MSTR\u2019s share price might be resistant to bitcoin downturns <em>as long as it buys the dip</em>, which it probably will, <a href=\"https://microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-proposed-private-offering-of-1-75b-of-convertible-senior-notes_11-18-2024\">considering the debt raises keep coming</a>. In the meantime, shareholders are no doubt enjoying the show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As would MicroStrategy execs and insiders, who\u2019ve now offloaded almost $559 million in company shares so far this year, per OpenInsider data, which compiles SEC filings (almost three-quarters going to Saylor, who\u2019s said that he intends to buy bitcoin himself).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they say the key to building generational wealth is diversification.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Companies that embrace the framework\u2019s rigorous standards won\u2019t just stay afloat; they\u2019ll dominate, using compliance as a strategic weapon to outpace competitors, drive mergers and acquisitions, and secure their position in a rapidly consolidating market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA\u2019s introduction is poised to ignite a surge in mergers and acquisitions across Europe\u2019s crypto sector, as regulatory compliance becomes a key driver of deal-making. Firms that master MiCA\u2019s standards won\u2019t just protect their market positions \u2014 they\u2019ll gain a competitive edge, leveraging compliance credentials to attract partners, investors and buyers. Consolidation will be a natural response to rising operational costs, with smaller players seeking alliances in order to survive and thrive. Meanwhile, I foresee larger firms capitalizing on similar opportunities to expand their footprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wave of consolidation will most likely signal a major shift in the competitive dynamics of the European crypto sector. As smaller firms struggle to shoulder the costs of compliance, their strategic value to larger, more resourceful players will only grow. For acquirers, MiCA-compliant firms represent a safer bet, offering established infrastructure, robust internal controls and governance systems already aligned with regulatory demands. With MiCA emphasizing operational soundness and investor protection, these companies will become prime targets, reducing risks and accelerating post-acquisition integration. In this new era, compliance won\u2019t just be a cost \u2014 it\u2019ll be a mechanism for growth, reshaping the competitive landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/micar-foreign-stablecoins-advantage-in-europe\">MiCAR will give foreign stablecoins a clear advantage in Europe</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework itself sets a high bar for transparency and accountability. Under MiCA, any firm planning to invest in or acquire a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) or an asset-referenced token (ART) issuer must notify the national competent authority (NCA) in their EU member state in writing. CASPs, which include companies offering services like trading, custody or asset transfers, will now face detailed regulatory reviews to ensure the deal complies with MiCA\u2019s strict standards.<br /><br />The acquiring party must also provide detailed information to the NCA to facilitate an evaluation of the proposed acquisition or any expansion of an existing qualifying stake. Regulatory due diligence will play a critical role in these transactions under MiCA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/european-union-guidelines-clarify-mica\">European securities regulator seeks limits on non-EU crypto firms</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key factors for approval include the reputation and leadership track record of the acquiring party, the ongoing compliance of the target ART issuer or CASP with MiCA regulations, and the financial stability of the acquirer. These elements will be closely scrutinized to ensure that both parties meet MiCA\u2019s stringent standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While NCAs have other measures that will factor in, it\u2019s clear that MiCA compliance is critical for M&amp;A success. Firms that have clearly established controls in place will be the winners, independent of which aisle of the deal they sit on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firms that fail to comply with MiCA, however, will face serious challenges in the M&amp;A market as their regulatory gaps make them riskier and less appealing to buyers. Non-compliance can lead to fines, expensive fixes or devaluation during due diligence. For non-EU firms, acquiring a MiCA-compliant company to attempt to benefit from the \u201cgrandfathering period,\u201d might seem like an easy way to enter the European market, but this comes with strict ESMA oversight. Regulators will be focused on ensuring investor protection and proper integration of EU-regulated functions, meaning non-EU firms must avoid tactics like regulatory loopholes or improper solicitation that could raise red flags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA-compliant firms will remain attractive targets for non-EU companies seeking easier entry into the European market. Without a MiCA license, non-EU firms risk being excluded from the EU entirely, as the reverse solicitation principle \u201cshould be understood as very narrowly framed and as such must be regarded as the exception; and it cannot be assumed, nor exploited to circumvent MiCA.\u201d To succeed, non-EU acquirers must fully integrate and comply with MiCA\u2019s requirements to meet EU regulatory standards and operate smoothly within the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoin-regulation-necessary-now-us\">The time for US stablecoin regulation is now&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, MiCA\u2019s strict approval process \u2014 focused on reputation, financial stability and compliance \u2014 will ensure that only the most prepared companies thrive in post-acquisition integrations. Firms that fully embrace MiCA\u2019s framework will be best positioned to lead, setting new standards for trust, innovation and sustainable growth in Europe\u2019s evolving crypto ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Bakkt sustained its rally into Tuesday (trading 7% higher midway through the session), while DJT lost more than 8%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social media company began trading on the Nasdaq last spring after a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently hovering around $30, DTJ shares are up almost 150% from their September low, but are still trading about 40% off of their IPO price of $50.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Media\u2019s recent gains have not been linear, though. Shares rose 65% at the end of October, a rally attributed to increased optimism at the time that Trump <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/prediction-markets-election-odds\">would win</a> the election. The share price since Trump\u2019s victory however has been flat, posting a modest increase the day after the election before erasing gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, presumably, confused about what a Trump win means for the social media company. Yesterday\u2019s rise shows that investors are decently certain that acquiring Bakkt would be a good move. But the subsequent retreat shows shareholders aren\u2019t exactly sure <em>why</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be following the acquisition story and will be writing a lot more about what it means when the majority shareholder of a public company moves into the White House.

But that month, the SEC said it <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-delays-bitcoin-etf-options-proposals\">needed more time</a> to consider the proposals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The SEC, on Sept. 20, gave \u201caccelerated\u201d approval of options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). About a month later, the SEC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-approves-cboe-nyse-options-btc-etfs\">greenlit the bids</a> by NYSE and CBOE to list options on other bitcoin ETFs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The CFTC last week essentially yielded to the SEC and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9008-24\">saying</a> that the listing of these bitcoin ETF options \u201cdoes not implicate the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The OCC said in a Monday <a href=\"https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemo/search?utm_source=forward-guidance.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=last-week-today&amp;_bhlid=cc18d512040548fa9bc7f854de1b4deae9cd23de\">memo</a> that it was \u201cpreparing for the clearance, settlement and risk management\u201d of bitcoin ETF options.

Options on IBIT are available today; that fund has grown to have roughly $43 billion in assets under management \u2014 making it by far the largest bitcoin ETF and even bigger than the iShares Gold Trust (IAU).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A few hundred million so far in options volume on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBIT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$IBIT</a> (a ton for Day One).. here's a rank of the contracts by volume, it's almost all calls.

Maybe 50/35/15 [percent], something like that,\u201d Peters said. \u201c[But] I think if you\u2019re right on that trade, you\u2019re gonna, at least for a period of time, wish you\u2019d had a million bucks in solana.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question was really posed within the immediate context. Still, we can backtest Peters\u2019 suggestion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even better, plot it alongside Coinbase\u2019s new benchmark crypto index <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/indexes/digital-assets/coinbase-50\">COIN50</a>, which is currently weighted 51.5% BTC, 23.4% ETH, 7% SOL with the remaining 18% or so spread across 47 other altcoins including DOGE, XRP, BCH and BONK.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegmmGnRDQiqk9TJjDWKlvEQz_RUF3P9SXxyKmGrmcf6KXsFgs-TCEcpEMh80fQFw5AIu-85VNS40byP8klSJ5ZdIMi6dUes0TDQZvt3wXiwXalps30Ub9t9m-pNvbEJ7WfcXiz?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above, in log view, plots the value of that $1 million allocation from the end of 2020, which is when COIN50\u2019s performance data starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s indeed an element of time bias. The period starts in the leadup to the epic 2021 bull run when SOL\u2019s market cap was under $100 million (now $117 billion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, back then, it would be questionable just how likely it would be to split a million-dollar allocation between BTC, ETH, and a token so small in relative terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the purple shows the split highlighted by Peters, which turned $1 million into $27 million and would now be at all-time highs for dollar value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETH maxis were second best with $4.2 million. And while there are currently no ETPs tracking COIN50, if there were, that vehicle would\u2019ve converted to a $3.8 million portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who aped a million dollars in BTC meanwhile would be holding $3.15 million right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For scale: Anyone who bought an index fund tracking any major benchmark from legacy finance would, at best, be sitting on $1.64 million, via the Nasdaq 100.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a minimum $1.5 million difference between stocks and crypto. It\u2019s hard to put an exact value on risk appetite, but that\u2019s as solid a number as any.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

One such project that\u2019s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren\u2019t useful if they aren\u2019t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation\u2019s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren\u2019t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example \u2014 the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren\u2019t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins \u201cget there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform\u2019s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan\u2019s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem\u2019s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana\u2019s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Industry AI was bloody impressive for a project completed in a few days, and its capabilities spanned the entire onchain experience, from wallet creation and launching an NFT collection to trading tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4h5geAKszxomQJr-hpFdWqkpvoyw0yhnq8N8HJliqSzbs9y66cAsS1GDlT7FQHt8ctBo1k2SRqM9cXTSQOUujrwBv1wO52VcxiM6gVS6ET3naMQFtXpta_KcJqp5H9LbbIXX8dA?key=ABNeh2MGSHsSTQy-jt2chRtH\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/industry-ai-4w3vy\">EthGlobal</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there was also <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/daogenie-nha62\">DAOGenie</a>, another top 10 finalist that sought to streamline the thick bureaucracy of DAO governance with AI agents. AI applied to DAO governance isn\u2019t a new idea, and it\u2019s something that major DAOs like Maker have been <a href=\"https://forum.sky.money/t/the-5-phases-of-endgame/20830\">experimenting</a> with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute ease in which AI agents can be integrated to serve crypto use cases is largely thanks to Coinbase Developer Platform\u2019s (CDP) <a href=\"https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentkit/docs/welcome\">AgentKit SDK</a> running LLMs under the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such tools are making the intersection of AI and crypto simpler. If developers can do it in a multiday hackathon, brace yourself for what organized and well-funded teams are going to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse Pollak, founder of Base, told me confidently at Devcon: \u201cBase is right now at the center of the onchain AI economy. One big focus for us in the next couple months is the use of AI agents for messaging on the XMTP protocol within Coinbase Wallet. We see messaging as a key channel for AI agents to become useful points of reference.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that stuck out to me at the ETHGlobal hackathon was the natural blend of AI agents with the permissionless ethic of crypto building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In crypto sits an openly accessible stack of world-class tools that are processing billions of dollars in value daily. These battle-tested financial building blocks \u2014 DEXs, L1/L2s, bridges \u2014 are going out of their way to incentivize crypto devs to integrate AI agents to capture value for themselves, in ways that centralized exchanges and banks cannot or will not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that Robinhood or Wells Fargo aren\u2019t looking at AI agents, but that innovation will inevitably be slow and introduced in piecemeal ways within the permissioned confines of TradFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, it\u2019s the simple profit motive at work. But only in the case of crypto are the rules of the game far more competitive and the pace of innovation moving at breakneck speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That might explain part of the hype that has captured the imaginations of crypto researchers looking into how AI agents can reshape the blockchain economy and the onchain experience as we know it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of AI agents is also but only one sliver of use cases <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/decentralize-ai-to-curb-big-tech\">applied to crypto</a>, in addition to a whole host of other use cases such as data training (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-wallets-grass-airdrop\">Grass</a>), zero-knowledge machine learning (<a href=\"https://gizatech.xyz/\">Giza</a>), and of course decentralized compute (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_9690fc34-cf42-4cb2-94fe-a7589dc910bc\">Akash</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Turns out, the firm is averaging \u201ca little bit over $10 billion a day across our futures suite.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust comparing November this year to last, our volume and contract terms are up more than 5x \u2026 and then we\u2019re also seeing increases or records in terms of open interest, where November is also the record month, averaging more than 166,000 contracts. And that\u2019s up 60% compared to October, and up over 3x compared to November 2023,\u201d Vicioso said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The large bitcoin contracts offered by CME are becoming so big that investors \u2014 primarily retail \u2014 are turning to CME\u2019s micro bitcoin contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRv7msYK1At1aAnjROZlZGEiPE29QRCTDPLp2ZAh-YW8Axeg_UVAs6upccd0sCRUB8KlDOSsafq_3m5bI78j0bOgvCMsWN_fw4wSHXg3uBKYsB5SjcJhz5RaBpZLItAzApU4bsqg?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A look at the volume CME\u2019s seen since the election</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing an increase in volume in terms of our micro contracts, where those contracts, over the last couple weeks, have been averaging more than a billion dollars a day. When we look at the year, our micro bitcoin contract was averaging between $200 to $300 million per day, and we\u2019re also seeing an uptick in terms of the representation of that smaller contract to the larger contract, whereas for the year, micro bitcoin futures volume represented roughly 6% of bitcoin volumes,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOver the past few trading sessions, we\u2019ve seen a micro contract represent now north of 15% or so of the large bitcoin contracts. We\u2019ve really seen increases across the board.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The makeup of participants is mixed, Vicioso noted. Micro contracts are seeing a fairly even spread of retail and institutional buyers given that the margin is a more \u201cmanageable\u201d number. The readthrough for institutions, in that case, is that they could be testing out fresh strategies and finetuning their exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeyKqSkTfYEiDoHwWW98_nThb-ObQmiaLFiLHB43HCfK6R3yAyugsM8bYI6uk_UDs1T0swKRWA9P4e1xP5GQxRee9lCInAC5e9NvM6tl-lYR942jYPHi_-129VX-Rz0ULDqViQs3A?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: CME</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of this interest, there is a pickup in volatility across both ether and bitcoin. Vicioso said it\u2019s \u201cpar for the course\u201d and isn\u2019t terribly worried. But he noted that the momentum we\u2019ve seen from bitcoin has carried through a lot of this year and it looks to be a continuing trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large Open Interest Holders \u2014 which means any entity holding over 25 contracts \u2014 is soaring. As of last Friday, CME recorded a record of around 600 large open interest holders in their futures contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo both our standard BTC and ETH contracts, as well as our micro BTC and ETH contracts, all achieved records in terms of the number of large open interest holders holding those contracts,\u201d Vicioso said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 19, 2024 at 2:36 pm ET: Corrected Open Interest to Large Open Interest Holders.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>The longtime Ethereum DeFi giant Sky has deployed its USDS stablecoin on Solana, the protocol told Blockworks exclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDS, which was formerly known as DAI, is the third largest stablecoin by market capitalization, trailing just USDT and USDC. The token had been exclusive to Ethereum since launching in 2017 leading up to today\u2019s deployment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sky was formerly known as Maker prior to its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/maker-rebrands-as-sky-dai-will-be-changed-to-usds\">late-August rebrand</a>. It\u2019s all part of the years-long \u201cendgame\u201d process being carried out by Sky co-founder Rune Christensen. The endgame comes with a slew of changes to one of the oldest DeFi protocols.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christensen has made clear his admiration of Solana, floating the idea of using a <a href=\"http://freestreams-live1.im/new-york-mets-live-stream/\">fork</a> of Solana\u2019s code to build a new chain in 2023. USDS will be made multichain with the help of Wormhole\u2019s native token transfer framework.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/multichain-native-token-transfers\">Wormhole goes multichain with native token transfers</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDS\u2019 growth will be incentivized on Solana through liquidity incentive agreements with the DeFi platforms Jupiter, Orca, Kamino and Drift. Sky said the projects will distribute \u201cover 300,000\u201d USDS weekly in liquidity incentives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin took a similar approach when <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/paypal-pyusd-stablecoin-live-on-solana\">recently deploying on Solana</a>, shelling out lucrative liquidity incentives to drive market capitalization, particularly on the DeFi platform Kamino. A lot of this liquidity didn\u2019t stick around once the incentives dried up, as Solana\u2019s PYUSD market share has fallen precipitously since August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/solana\">Solana</a> and Sky meet each other in a position of mutual need. Sky\u2019s rebrand has been bumpy, and community backlash caused the protocol to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/maker-considers-rebranding-further\">hold a vote</a> about whether to rebrand a second time (Sky won convincingly in a vote <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/325096/just-four-entities-account-for-nearly-all-the-votes-to-keep-makerdaos-rebranding-to-sky\">dominated</a> by four whales). And despite the run-up in nearly every Solana metric, Solana\u2019s stablecoin market share has yet to meaningfully increase. The chain <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins/chains\">holds</a> just 2% of all stablecoins compared to 51% for Ethereum, per DeFiLlama.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Sky, deploying on the moment\u2019s buzziest blockchain could give its community something to rally behind. And for Solana, gaining access to the third-largest stablecoin could help grow its slice of the pie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 19, 2024 at 12:12 pm ET: A prior version of this article stated DAI was launched in 2014.

Crypto assets \u2014 mostly insulated from the selloff \u2014 were largely maintaining their post-election rally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with what caused last week\u2019s dip in equities. In my view, it was a bit of a perfect storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOP sweep, as expected, sent share prices higher. When Trump won in 2016, the S&amp;P 500 gained about 6% between election night and Inauguration Day, a slightly bigger bump than the index saw when George W. Bush won in 2000 (+4%).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, apparently, once again betting on <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-trump-potential-tariff-policies\">Trump\u2019s plans</a> (lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, etc.) as being <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-lenient-crypto-regulation\">good for business</a>. Or, at least the market felt this way until last Thursday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s face it: Trump\u2019s cabinet picks thus far have been controversial. The process, in just two weeks, has been chaotic and dramatic \u2014 likely reminding investors that while a red sweep is typically advantageous for shareholders, a Trump presidency is still, well, a Trump presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These past couple weeks have not exactly been reassuring for those hoping for smooth-sailing politics over the next four years. Couple that with increasing concerns over the economic impacts of Trump\u2019s planned tariffs and mass deportations and it\u2019s no wonder markets pulled back.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter perfect storm condition number two: Inflation is still rising while the job market is proving remarkably resilient. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 9 came in at 217,000 vs. the expected 224,000. Core CPI for October showed prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago; that was in line with expectations, but still a far cry from the Fed\u2019s 2% target.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination makes the Fed\u2019s job more difficult. Chair Jerome Powell told us as much last week when he cautioned the central bank is in no hurry to lower interest rates and will continue to evaluate the data. This week\u2019s data will be telling (but more on that later).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doom and gloom aside, stocks were looking up today. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.7% as of 2 pm ET. Bitcoin, which seemed to hit a new all-time high almost everyday <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/450b-behemoth-forging-btc-path-to-100k\">last week</a>, was holding steady, hovering around $90,300 Monday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, several big companies report third quarter earnings this week, likely moving markets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the largest publicly listed company by market cap in the world, Nvidia on Wednesday will be the highlight.

        "content": "<p>Vyper, Ethereum\u2019s Python-inspired smart contract language for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/evmhttps://blockworks.co/tag/evm\">EVM</a>), recently marked an anniversary. However, <a href=\"https://x.com/alyriadefi/status/1858072267793838410\">chatter</a> out of Devcon suggests its development team is struggling with <a href=\"https://x.com/pcaversaccio/status/1851987514413756791\">underfunding</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conceived by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in <a href=\"https://x.com/fubuloubu/status/1857347299128606843\">November 2016</a>, Vyper set out to provide a simpler, more secure alternative to <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/glossary/#solidity-programming-language-ethereum\">Solidity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper\u2019s clean, Python-inspired syntax prioritizes readability and restricts complex features to minimize vulnerabilities \u2014 a boon for developers focused on writing secure and robust smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curve Finance was a high profile application of the language, and founder Michael Egorov took to his Telegram channel over the weekend to reminisce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI started using Vyper in 2019 when I started creating <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/curve\">Curve</a>. Just like in 2005 I fell in love with Python, same happened with Vyper,\u201d Egorov wrote, noting that it is \u201cprobably the best way to write safe smart contracts for [the] Ethereum ecosystem.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Security has always been a cornerstone of Vyper\u2019s philosophy. It has generally enjoyed a strong <a href=\"https://x.com/bennylada/status/1851657706983375070\">track record</a>, though a 2023 high-profile exploit in the Vyper compiler caused a lot of damage to Curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/post-curve-defi-landscape\">How DeFi users are navigating post-Curve exploit landscape</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Egorov noted, Vyper boasts a well-documented history of audits, with all reports available publicly on its <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories\">GitHub repository</a>. Vyper developers have also implemented processes for managing vulnerabilities, as highlighted in its <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories\">security advisories</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emphasis on transparency and public reviews aligns with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s broader ethos of decentralization and community trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper\u2019s influence in the Ethereum ecosystem has seen a steady decline over the past few years. Once commanding a notable share of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, Vyper peaked at 30% in August 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdA2YHmDmRzmRT4v0QwHYX3c15Csm6n73o4Xp1hjHD5G4X_MnJytIBXI6rDv3atfKTfeFFvYq4X5JGcY4qh-RW9EoryL-ugPMOgujLgHRIw0sID8IK5tfm9JySyveQniz5fR7YVaw?key=xOdZlJiqPI0WdTm4JOcOblQn\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>DeFi TVL dominance by smart contract language |<strong> </strong>Source: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/languages\">Defillama</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its share has steadily eroded since, falling to 13.8% by early 2022, 7.6% by the start of 2023, and just 2.2% at the beginning of 2024. As of this month, Vyper accounts for only about 1% of DeFi TVL, illustrating how the language has struggled to maintain momentum against Solidity\u2019s dominance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper and Solidity differ significantly in design philosophy and features. In contrast, Solidity\u2019s JavaScript-like syntax is more complex but allows for greater flexibility, catering to developers with experience in traditional programming languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity benefits from a mature and extensive ecosystem, with a wide range of tools, libraries and community support, making it the standard for the vast majority of Ethereum projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This expansive tooling and the Web3 developer mind share around Solidity have likely contributed to this shift, although it must be noted Vyper\u2019s decline <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/curve-finance\">mirrors</a> the rise and fall of TVL within Curve itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its shrinking share, Vyper remains a valuable option for security-focused projects, even as its influence in shaping Ethereum smart contract development has waned over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it is time for a reversal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Egorov, history offers an interesting parallel: In 2005, Python was also a niche language overshadowed by PHP and Java. Over time, Python\u2019s clarity and versatility propelled it to dominate industries like AI and data science. Similarly, Vyper\u2019s focus on security and readability could spark a renaissance as a future-proof language for the next wave of dapps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of Python developers in the world, a fact that <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/algorand-adopts-python\">Algorand is banking on</a> to bring in a fresh class of developers following the adoption earlier this year of Python as its canonical language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ethereum developers, Vyper may now serve a niche audience \u2014 those prioritizing security and simplicity over extensive features. Yet, for projects needing concise and secure smart contracts, it remains a compelling option.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Arca and BlockTower are merging in an all-equity deal, the companies announced last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg talked to Blockworks about the merger, timing and what this next cycle could look like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two had been in talks to merge for a little over two months, Steinberg said. They\u2019d always been close, but the merger just \u201cmade so much sense\u201d after talks ramped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from BlockTower\u2019s venture team, which will be spun out, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/arca\">Arca</a> and BlockTower plan to retain all their talent under one umbrella. Steinberg will lead the new company, with Jeff Dorman staying on as chief investment officer. Ari Paul, CIO and founder of BlockTower, will be moving to an advisory role, though Steinberg believes he\u2019ll be \u201cvery involved.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steinberg pointed out that the two had to move quickly due to \u201ccrypto years,\u201d which pass much faster than in other sectors. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year, and Steinberg said he couldn\u2019t even imagine what crypto would look like if they waited another whole year to close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/m-a-deals-shifting-tide\">Latest crypto M&amp;A deals signal \u2018the tide is shifting\u2019</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is for the new entity to become a \u201cone-stop shop for sophisticated investors.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the overall political environment wasn\u2019t a huge factor, it\u2019s definitely going to benefit the new company going forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe see this as a huge white space for the token market,\u201d Steinberg told me. Previously, tokens had been \u201chandicapped\u201d because they haven\u2019t been able to offer elements such as fee switches. If the regulation or enforcement actions around tokens loosen, then Steinberg is confident that he\u2019s bringing the best team to the table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about saying that there shouldn\u2019t be regulations or things like that, but sensible regulations that make sense,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-lenient-crypto-regulation\">Traders are banking on Trump\u2019s pro-crypto action</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just tokens that are going to benefit from the new environment. Steinberg said he also remains bullish on activists investing in DAOs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cinefficiencies in the space\u201d have not allowed it to \u201cmature, in having people that drive good governance thinking about outcomes for token holders,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not knocking any regulatory regime or thinking about that. But just when you have an environment where you\u2019ve kind of disallowed any productive use of tokens, from fee switches to utility or things like that\u2026contrary to what you would probably want, you create an environment where only things like memecoins have any real traction, because they literally, by definition, cannot offer anything of a tangible value.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arca doesn\u2019t have any plans for \u201cspecific lobbying,\u201d Steinberg said. But the new company will continue to be a \u201csteward\u201d for the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more clarity, he believes, we\u2019ll see both traditional and activist investors get more involved which, in turn, makes him more bullish. This could also lead to further consolidation down the line as crypto readjusts in the next cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

We also understand which addresses have access to those coins, as well as how long they\u2019ve been held without moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we <em>don\u2019t</em> know is how many coins are lost forever \u2014 BTC tied to private keys that have been destroyed, misplaced or otherwise not passed on after death and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some estimates <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/37171/lost-bitcoin-3-7-million-bitcoin-are-probably-gone-forever\">suggest</a> around 20% of all BTC won\u2019t ever move again, the equivalent of 3.7 million BTC ($318 billion).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll never uncover the private keys for all those coins, but we will always know exactly where they\u2019re sitting onchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same can\u2019t be said for gold and silver. World Gold Council <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/how-much-gold\">reckons</a> 212,582 tonnes of gold had been mined across all of history as of the end of last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of that, 45% of it has been made into jewelry, 22% in bars and coins, 17% held by central banks and the rest is scattered across the world in various other forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on those figures, the total value of mined gold (analogous to circulating supply) is about $18 trillion. But who knows how much of it is readily available to be brought to market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data for total above-ground supplies for silver is similarly vague. <a href=\"https://8marketcap.com/\">InfinteMarketCap</a>, which tracks all assets against each other, goes by the 2019 CPM Group Silver Yearbook, which says that 1.751 million metric tonnes of silver have been mined to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94526\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-15.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Permanently flipping silver will be a milestone for bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At current prices, that would put silver\u2019s market cap at nearly $1.9 trillion \u2014 almost $200 billion higher than what InfiniteMarketCap shows right now, putting it ahead of bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, just how much silver is really out there is an unsolvable mystery. For what it\u2019s worth, a gold <a href=\"https://www.goldpriceforecast.com/explanations/size-the-silver-market/\">blog</a> (probably biased) in 2021 sized silver, within the context of the financial market, at only $108 billion, having removed all silver used for industrial purposes and jewelry from its estimates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would make silver much, much smaller than bitcoin, which is today at $1.8 trillion. But going by the same loose definitions that award gold an $18 trillion value, silver is still bigger than bitcoin \u2014 but only just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what would it take for bitcoin to flip both silver <em>and</em> gold? The moon math says bitcoin would need to hit $96,000 to eclipse silver \u2014 if it trades flat from here \u2014 and $910,000 to surpass gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it: a single 10x is the goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The firm, which focuses on pre-seed investing, has carved out a niche of being high conviction, Wang said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fund only invests in one project per category, which allows for the fund to lend full support to its investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret formula that\u2019s worked for Portal, Wang said, is a combination of three elements: the \u201cbest\u201d founder and tracking down a thesis that\u2019s only just emerging and the third is the \u201cnetwork to king make.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Fisher, there\u2019s \u201csomething very special about being someone\u2019s first believer\u201d and watching them execute on an idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two launched their first fund in early 2022, which may not have started in rough waters but certainly ended in them as crypto struggled to survive the collapse of FTX and the depegging of Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around, it was also difficult for Fisher and Wang to raise their fund. They started at the beginning of the year, which was well before bitcoin was carving out new daily all-time highs. Though, clearly, they\u2019re facing a different environment as they look to put the money to work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second fund is bigger than the first \u2014 which was a $40 million fund \u2014 and it speaks to their overall high-risk, high-reward strategy, Fisher said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe try to really generate signal for the industry,\u201d Fisher told Blockworks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other notable news:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Notabene <a href=\"https://x.com/notabene_id/status/1856357556999905676\">said</a> it raised $14.5 million in a Series B round.

The SEC is violating federalism and separation of powers, the attorneys general state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The language is reminiscent of similar suits we\u2019ve seen in the past. In <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-appeals-sec-rulemaking-petition\">Coinbase\u2019s lawsuit</a> against the SEC, the exchange alleged securities regulators were unlawfully overstepping.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe [SEC] is asserting sweeping new authority over a vibrant, rapidly expanding industry \u2014 digital assets,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s team wrote in the opening brief of the case. \u201cBut the SEC is pursuing this power grab <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-2023-crypto-enforcement-actions\">through enforcement actions</a>, and it has refused to set forth its new interpretation of its enabling statutes in a rulemaking, where the lack of legal basis for its self-aggrandizement would be laid bare.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The states\u2019 legal action comes as the industry continues to hold out hope that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term will bring a new era of crypto policy. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to \u201cfire Gary Gensler on day one\u201d and hire Tesla CEO Elon Musk to overhaul \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d have many crypto fans hopeful the \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d age is coming to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler, who has not shared any plans to leave the agency, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424?utm_source=forward-guidance.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=states-serve-sec\">said</a> during a Thursday legal conference in New York that the SEC, under his leadership, has been backed by the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCourt after court has agreed with our actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered \u2014 whatever their form,\u201d Gensler said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When closing out his Thursday remarks, though, Gensler made a comment that could be an allusion to his possible departure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a great honor to serve with them, doing the people\u2019s work, and ensuring that our capital markets remain the best in the world,\u201d Gensler said, thanking the staff and his fellow commissioners at the agency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we wrote about last week, SEC chairs tend to resign when the incoming administration differs from the one under which they were appointed. Former Chair (and new US attorney to the SDNY) Jay Clayton announced his resignation on Nov. 16, 2020 after President Joe Biden won.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

The joke at the time was that a weird <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ai-memecoin-trumps-wlfi-token-sale\">AI chat bot had upstaged</a> Donald Trump\u2019s World Liberty Financial crypto token launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That order of things wouldn\u2019t last long however, as Trump\u2019s presidential election win sent crypto markets surging and overshadowed the resurgent AI-crypto interest. Still, the AI projects spawned and spotlighted during October\u2019s rally have continued apace, even if their star now shines a little less brightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s still the goat-themed token that started it all, whose chat bot will occasionally post about tokens on X but spends most of its time consumed with edgy posts and uncanny valley AI art. That hasn\u2019t stopped its coin from surging to over $1.1 billion in market capitalization however, leaving the AI bot\u2019s public wallet with almost half a billion-worth in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth_terminal set off a wave of interest surrounding AI agents who interact with humans to do some kind of blockchain action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtuals Protocol is one such project on the Base layer-2. \u201cPump dot fun for AI agents\u201d lets users purchase tokens associated with autonomous AI agents in hopes of the AI bots attracting more investment as they do more interesting things. The most popular Virtuals agent has sprung to $115 million in market capitalization, a 106% increase over the past 24 hours as much of the Ethereum community gathers for Devcon in Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But memecoins are the center of the late AI hype, and Solana is the center of memecoins. One new project in this domain is ai16z, a group that has an AI bot which invests in memecoins based on the recommendations of its members. The project came out of daos.fun, a new crowdfunding mechanism for DAOs on Solana <a href=\"https://x.com/lmrankhan/status/1846257066500923817\">spun</a> up at Alliance DAO. Ai16z\u2019s AI version of Marc Andreessen also <a href=\"https://x.com/pmarca/status/1850312932757770385\">drew</a> a social media shoutout from the real life version of the a16z boss, which is apparently becoming an important component of launching a crypto-AI project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also crypto-AI outfits with grander ambitions. This week, I spoke to Ryan Trattner from DAIN protocol, which is a network for onchain AI apps and bots. Trattner, who was formerly a contractor at the Solana University non-profit, thinks that the future will comprise many AI agents doing different things, so he\u2019s helping build DAIN to house them all. He demonstrated to me how an AI agent on the network can <a href=\"https://x.com/dainprotocol/status/1847780512732950949\">order</a> a Chick-Fil-A sandwich and how a different one could trade bitcoin based on Polymarket\u2019s presidential election odds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trattner said DAIN could let him \u201corder food in the same [interface] where I\u2019m trading my memecoins.\u201d That doesn\u2019t strike me as the most in-demand use for AI, but then again, with bitcoin shooting above $90,000, everything seems to be on the table right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even though the headlines and X feeds seemed to have cooled on AI-crypto integrations for the moment, those AI-crypto startups don\u2019t seem to be losing steam.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The latest keynote on the topic was Martin Koeppelmann of Gnosis, who spoke Friday on the event\u2019s main stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/tornado-cash\">Tornado Cash</a> t-shirt, Koeppelmann challenged the status quo of layer-2 <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/rollups\">rollups</a>, proposing that Ethereum should instead develop and deploy its own zk-proven rollups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koeppelmann emphasized the limitations of existing rollups such as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/base\">Base</a>, which he argued are bringing users not to Ethereum but to corporate-controlled platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have the highest respect for Jesse [Pollack] and Coinbase,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut bringing people to those L2 ecosystems is quite different from being on Ethereum.\u201d He warned of the potential for shareholder-driven decisions \u2014 like the introduction of additional fees in the future \u2014 that could undermine the Ethereum ethos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A central critique was the marketing claim that rollups \u201cinherit Ethereum\u2019s security.\u201d While possible in principle, Koeppelmann noted that <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/layer-2-secured-by-ethereum\">none of them does</a> in practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He illustrated vulnerabilities such as central sequencers\u2019 ability to censor withdrawals or manipulate state in DeFi platforms like Aave, <a href=\"https://x.com/koeppelmann/status/1857053973431103955\">as articulated</a> in a Devcon talk by James Prestwhich. Moreover, he noted that most assets on rollups are native to those chains, not subject to Ethereum\u2019s security guarantees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What would native L2\u2019s look like?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Koeppelmann envisioned 128 identical interoperable native L2s, rigorously built with Ethereum\u2019s high standards \u2014 no multisigs, multiple client implementations, and community scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number is a bit arbitrary, but \u201cthe idea is to make it clear that building on Ethereum is a long-term viable option,\u201d he explained, with a goal to achieve a \u201c100x increase in effective block space\u201d over the next two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rollups would maintain strong composability with Ethereum while addressing scalability, cost, and user adoption for billions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key to his proposal is integrating these rollups into Ethereum\u2019s economic framework. For instance, Ethereum validator rewards could incentivize proof correctness, enhancing security and aligning rollups with Ethereum\u2019s values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers would have the option to build directly \u201con Ethereum\u201d rather than on external ecosystems, with the choice of a specific rollup dependent on the dapp\u2019s needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf there are other applications you want to regularly interact with [on a specific rollup], then it would be wise to choose that rollup.\u201d However, for developers requiring only Ethereum mainnet connectivity, \u201cyou should just choose the rollup that is used the least, because that will be the cheapest.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also called for distinct namespaces to prevent address collisions across these L2s, improving cross-chain clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koeppelmann concluded by urging the Ethereum community to act decisively. Without native L2s, he warned, Ethereum\u2019s role could diminish: \u201cThe connection between rollups and Ethereum becomes a meme.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, embracing native rollups could position Ethereum as \u201cthe most important economic zone in the world.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum stands at this crossroads, Koeppelmann said, as he challenged the broad community to rethink scalability and governance while staying true to its decentralized ideals.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

After all, the first coins were sold only for the cost of the energy spent to mine them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, there\u2019s so much more to it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t just powered by its industrialized mining sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s now a whole Crypto-Industrial Complex forging a path for bitcoin and the wider crypto space \u2014 and it\u2019s worth almost half a trillion dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94487\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-14.png\" width=\"944\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The half-trillion behemoth at the heart of crypto</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, the entire crypto market \u2014 as in the actual coins and tokens \u2014 has a $3 trillion-plus capitalization.

Or Solana Labs and Binance, although the latter would\u2019ve almost certainly taken a meaty hit to its valuation after its run-in with the DOJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention the other funds holding billions in crypto altogether that aren\u2019t ETFs, which don\u2019t show up in this data, like Bitwise\u2019s index fund BITW and the ever-expanding roster of Grayscale trusts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94486\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-13.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Crypto-Industrial Complex now closely follows the price of bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, for many, the Crypto-Industrial Complex as presented here would be the first points of entry into crypto (and, perhaps more critically for this newsletter, their valuations are easily trackable: up 140% year-on-year and 50% above its previous top in 2021).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Michael Saylor, the bitcoin alpha bull provides the orange pull.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tether, the stablecoin with a compelling history, reveals just how deep the rabbit hole goes.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Uniswap, Lido and Aave form the basis for DeFi 101.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>All while the public miners help keep Bitcoin humming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crypto-Industrial Complex is always churning, gobbling up coins much faster than they can be mined and sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here we are, just one more ~10% rally away from $100,000.

        "content": "<p>Ethereum circles are endlessly debating whether ETH should be seen as \u201cmoney\u201d in the same way bitcoin is embraced as a commodity currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Devcon talk Thursday, Ethereum Foundation researcher Mike Neuder <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HAh09a5Qec\">laid out</a> his case for ether\u2019s foundational attributes both as a permissionless and programmable asset, and as a resilient form of decentralized money. Neuder explored how <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/eth\">ETH</a> can serve as a secure, global currency\u2014 one with intrinsic safeguards for property rights, censorship resistance, and self-sovereignty across the multi-layered Ethereum ecosystem, eventually including its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/rollups\">rollups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To explain Ethereum\u2019s \u201cpermissionlessness,\u201d Neuder referenced Hayek and Friedman on property rights, emphasizing the unique ownership Ethereum provides to holders of ETH being permissionlessly transferable, storable, and programmable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To distinguish ether from assets whose access can be limited by third parties, Neuder included a critique of centralized stablecoins such USDC and USDT, noting that despite their similar programmability, they lack true property rights. Issuers can, and do <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/tether-freezes-funds-doj\">freeze funds</a>. For Neuder, this capacity marks ETH as a distinct asset within onchain finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pivotal part of Neuder\u2019s presentation highlighted the expanding property rights of ETH across <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/layer-2-2\">layer-2</a> rollups.<br /><br />But there\u2019s a caveat: Rollups haven\u2019t yet reached a <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary\">Stage 2</a> decentralization classification. Once they do, they will allow users to bridge ETH in and out, permissionlessly, maintaining Ethereum\u2019s property rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to force withdrawals ensures that users can always reclaim their assets even if a rollup\u2019s sequencer, or central operator, attempts to censor or disrupt transactions. It\u2019s a core feature of <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/layer-2-secured-by-ethereum\">what it means to be a layer-2</a> network. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/arbitrum\">Arbitrum One</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/optimism\">OP Mainnet</a> have already reached Stage 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neuder detailed Ethereum\u2019s commitment to this mechanism as a way to enhance scaling while protecting users\u2019 autonomy in Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talk also addressed Ethereum\u2019s inflation model compared to other cryptocurrencies, situating it alongside <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> as an increasingly \u201csound\u201d currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Ethereum\u2019s transition to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/proof-of-stake\">proof-of-stake</a> in the 2022 <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum-merge\">Merge</a>, supply growth has significantly slowed, with inflation sitting near 0.9%. This is comparable to Bitcoin\u2019s current 0.8%, which it will maintain until the next <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/history-of-bitcoin-halvings-2\">halving</a> in 2028. Ethereum achieves this balance through a combination of issuance, staking rewards, and an <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/eip-1559\">ETH burn mechanism</a> that fluctuates with network demand, effectively absorbing inflationary pressures during periods of high transaction volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neuder argued that this adaptive model is crucial for long-term security, contrasting with Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply cap, which <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-network-secure-fees\">may pose challenges</a> for future network security once block rewards vanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to a question about the stability of the ether issuance curve, Neuder acknowledged that adjustments to issuance rates over time \u2014 from changes to the block reward under proof-of-work, to current proposals of tweaking the curve \u2014 have sparked ongoing debate over the importance of maintaining \u201cstrong assurances\u201d regarding ether\u2019s total supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Neuder noted that altering the curve could offer benefits \u2014 such as averting risks associated with high staking rates or the emergence of a dominant liquid staking token (LST) \u2014 he cautioned that frequent changes might undermine confidence in stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This uncertainty could in turn impact \u201ccredible neutrality,\u201d another core value vital for Ethereum\u2019s long-term resilience. Assessing the long-term trade-offs will require careful analysis, ideally involving input from macroeconomists, Neuder said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94469\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/mikeneuder\">Mike Neuder</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One crucial component of Ethereum\u2019s deflationary mechanics is the blob burn effect resulting from layer-2 activity. Ethereum rollups post transaction data to the Ethereum mainnet in \u201cblobs\u201d \u2014 bundles of data stored efficiently to reduce costs. As these blobs are published on the mainnet, they <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-blob-base-fee-surges\">incur fees</a>, a portion of which is burned, contributing to the overall ETH burn. This design enables Ethereum to absorb more L2 transaction activity without overwhelming the base layer, maintaining lower L1 gas fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As L2 usage grows, so does the blob burn effect, intensifying Ethereum\u2019s deflationary pressure during periods of high activity, such as we are seeing this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94468\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-12.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/analytics/eth\">Blockworks Research</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The total dollar value of ETH burned, over time, spiked dramatically beginning in early November to nearly $15 million. This increase in burned ETH is due to heightened network activity, as transaction fees contribute to the burn rate. As a ratio, the burn ratio reached 182%, resulting in a net reduction of ETH supply in recent days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some within the Ethereum community prefer to de-emphasize the role of ether as \u201csound\u201d money, or even dismiss it outright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tends to <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html\">discuss</a> Ethereum\u2019s value in terms of its programmability, flexibility, and commitment to decentralization rather than focusing on ETH as a purely monetary asset.There\u2019s a balance to be struck, and Neuder underlined Ethereum\u2019s prime aim, to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-inclusion-lists-scrutiny\">retain</a> credible neutrality and censorship resistance, positioning ETH as a form of digital money grounded in the ethos of self-sovereignty.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The number of crypto M&amp;A deals shrunk from 50 during the second quarter to 35 in Q3, Architect Partners data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPerhaps we\u2019re now at a new level of sustainable volume which is a major factor in the growth and profitability of trading-related crypto businesses,\u201d Risley explained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six of the 22 crypto M&amp;A deals so far announced in Q4 were revealed this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes two asset management-centric transactions shared yesterday: Bitwise\u2019s buy of Ethereum staking provider Attestant and an intended merge between Arca and BlockTower. Then this morning, Crypto.com said it bought Fintek Securities, a brokerage service and trading company with an Australian Financial Services Licence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let\u2019s not forget the other big deal last month (<a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/stripe-bridge-acquisition-stablecoin-infrastructure\">Stripe\u2019s buy of Bridge</a>), which Risley said \u201ccaught senior executive and board level attention across a broad array of crypto and traditional financial services companies.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tldr?

The difficult part of trying to gauge which promises are both realistic and probable now begins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I sat down with Dr. Stephen Miran, fellow at the Manhattan Institute and senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital. Miran was also at the US Treasury during the first Trump Administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His latest economic paper provides a toolkit of how to unpack and understand a world of increased global tariffs and other protectionist economic policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Titled <em>\u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System\u201d,</em> the paper is a fascinating roadmap into understanding the ultimate question surrounding a heavyhanded tariff policy: Will it be inflationary or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen began our interview discussing the \u201cTriffin world\u201d we live in. Simply put, a Triffin world is the consequence that comes with being the global reserve currency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dollar\u2019s status has for decades resulted in an overvalued currency (when compared to interest rate parity theory) and persistent and rising twin deficits (both a fiscal and a trade deficit).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Triffin world can quickly become a crisis for the reserve currency issuer \u2013 i.e a Triffin\u2019s dilemma, when the total share of global GDP secularly declines \u2014 like it has for the US in recent years:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94459\" height=\"1089\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-11.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, deficits widen and further strain the priorities of the reserve currency, creating an imbalance between domestic and international priorities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As proposed by Trump and analyzed by Dr. Miran, one way to \u201crecalibrate\u201d this strain is through either tariffs that rebalance these trade imbalances or an outright currency devaluation that brings the US dollar back in line with interest rate differentials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question from here is what could the impact of a tariff-heavy policy on domestic inflation be? How much of the price increases gets passed onto consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Dr. Miran analyzes in the paper, the key to this question lies in how much the currency offsets the increase in price:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94458\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-10.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, one of the key considerations for these tariffs being implemented is the context of the business cycle that we are in, as this will, in part, determine the tariffs\u2019 success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other side of the coin that the paper and interview discuss is outright multilateral and unilateral currency agreements and how they could also help recalibrate the USA from spiraling into a Triffin dilemma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for understanding the specifics of what style of currency agreement would work best, well you\u2019re just going to have to listen to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65aE9KFMR3Y\">interview</a> to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "published": "2024-11-14T19:06:09.000Z",
        "summary": "The app was conceived as a global equivalent to Venmo that uses the Solana network and Paxos\u2019 USDP stablecoin",
        "content": "<p>Sling Money, a global peer-to-peer payments app leveraging stablecoins and Solana, has launched for users with US bank accounts, the startup announced this morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app was conceived as a global equivalent to Venmo that uses the Solana network and Paxos\u2019 USDP stablecoin to move money around instantly for low fees. The move comes as the crypto industry as a whole seems emboldened operating in the US following Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sling Money was founded in 2022 by Mike Hudack, who previously was chief product officer at the UK-based neobank Monzo. I spoke with Hudack back in August, and he said he became interested in building a global Venmo with crypto rails after sending crypto from London to a friend in San Francisco while investing in a Montana-based DAO. The KYC protocol and wallet onboarding was onerous, but the payment went through almost instantly, and Hudack realized he\u2019d hit on something useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, Sling Money has deployed in more than 75 countries, which now includes the US. By using stablecoins in tandem with Solana, which charges a fraction of a cent in transaction fees, Sling Money is very efficient, at least if you put aside the question of on- and off-ramping funds. It also plans to make use of RTP and FedNow, which are faster payments networks developed by banks and the Federal Reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sling Money has raised $20 million in seed and Series A funding, but its cap table doesn\u2019t have typical crypto names on it: Union Square Ventures led its Series A in August, and Ribbit Capital and Slow Ventures are also investors. USV does a good number of crypto deals \u2014 it notably invested in Coinbase \u2014 but it is more of a generalist tech outfit. The same can be said for Ribbit and Slow. This is all to say that Sling Money isn\u2019t really styled as a crypto app, and it doesn\u2019t feel like one when you use it for peer-to-peer payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a crypto product or a fiat product. It\u2019s a payments product,\u201d Hudack told me in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venmo, the PayPal-owned payment platform with tens of millions of accounts in the United States, is the incumbent that Sling Money will have to chase. Like Venmo, Sling charges no transfer fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email, Hudack said he plans to pry away Venmo\u2019s market share by starting \u201cwhere Venmo isn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 that is, through international payments. Hudack said the team plans to follow WhatsApp\u2019s growth model by building a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of users for its international offering before convincing them that its product is good for use at home, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hudack added that Sling Money\u2019s bank transfers are faster than Venmo\u2019s, and it sees a potential opportunity to undercut the 1.5-3% that Venmo charges for instant bank withdrawals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Mills, who is a Solana ecosystem founder who previously headed up product at Venmo, told me on the Lightspeed podcast that despite all its users, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOCmHx8Dids\">Venmo was not profitable</a>. The legacy money transfer system is riddled with expenses that Venmo abstracts away, but Mills compared this to \u201cputting lipstick on a pig.\u201d With cheap and instant transfers facilitated on blockchain rails, Sling Money could ditch some of these expenses altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a society we\u2019ve spent the last ~25 years connecting the world through media,\u201d Hudack said. \u201cYou can stream video from any point on earth to any other point on earth, you can text anyone in the world, you can email, you can have a voice call with anyone on the planet. All for free. We\u2019ve got the technology now to connect the entire world financially and we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Cantor Fitzgerald has been trying to recruit for the program that is yet to be officially launched. If Tether decides to collaborate, it will be one of several financial contributors, anonymous sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.</p>\n<p>Cantor Fitzgerald already has deep business ties with Tether. Its custody business earns fees of tens of millions of dollars per year for holding the billions of dollars worth of U.S. treasury bills that back the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin Tether (USDT). In fact, Cantor Fitzgerald has continued to provide banking support to Tether even as several banks around the world have refused.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trump-taps-crypto-advocate-howard-lutnick-as-commerce-secretary/\">reported</a> on Nov. 24 that Cantor Fitzgerald agreed to acquire a 5% stake in Tether for around $600 million in the past year.</p>\n<p>Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trump-taps-crypto-advocate-howard-lutnick-as-commerce-secretary/\">nominated</a> Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, who also serves as one of Trump&#8217;s transition advisers, to be the next Commerce Secretary. Lutnick will resign as CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald once he receives senate confirmation.</p>\n<p>With Lutnick joining Trump&#8217;s administration next year, Tether can be expected to receive significant political support. According to The Wall Street Journal, Giancarlo Devasini, who is suspected of being the largest Tether shareholder, previously said that Lutnick will use his political influence to neutralize any potential threats against Tether.</p>\n<p>The WSJ report further claims that as transition adviser, Lutnick already has a say in who Trump selects for other top government roles, including those who could be supervising Tether.</p>\n<p>Tether has often been embroiled in controversy, with some questioning whether Tether has enough reserves for USDT to be backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars. Lutnick has personally vouched for Tether multiple times. In January this year, Lutnick confirmed that Tether does hold enough reserves to back its stablecoin.</p>\n<p>Besides, last month the WSJ reported that Tether was under investigation in the U.S. for potential violation of sanctions and anti-money laundering rules. Tether, however, refuted the claims.</p>\n<p>Lutnick is a known proponent of Bitcoin and digital assets. In September, Lutnick <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/cantor-fitzgerald-ceo-says-bitcoin-should-be-treated-as-a-commodity-like-gold-and-oil/\">said</a> that regulators should treat Bitcoin as a commodity, like gold or oil.

        "content": "<p><em>The following is a guest post from Leo Li, CVO and Chief Growth Officer at CARV.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off The Grid could be the mainstream moment we&#8217;ve been waiting for in web3 gaming \u2013 not because it flaunts blockchain features, but because it doesn&#8217;t. The major console release integrates NFTs and blockchain in the background, letting gameplay take center stage. The game is the main appeal, while the blockchain is a bonus that furthers trading, ownership, and expression.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like Telegram, which is quietly slipping crypto wallet functionality into hundreds of millions of pockets, game developers realize that simplicity is vital. Hitting gamers over the head with painful onboarding and crypto-heavy concepts can alienate potential players.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next gaming bull run will not be driven by </span><strong><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/gaming/\">blockchain games</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014it will be driven by great games that happen to use blockchain.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The quiet revolution in blockchain gaming</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off The Grid is causing a lot of noise for a game that&#8217;s not officially out yet. The cyberpunk battle royale from Gunzilla Games \u2013 only available via early access on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X \u2013 is getting plenty of attention for its tongue-in-cheek violence and gritty visuals from filmmaker Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Elysium). </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>\u201cPart schlocky satire of streaming culture, part sendup of gamers, all shrewd self-aware storytelling: Off The Grid is a fun time,\u201d </strong><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/why-you-should-be-playing-off-the-grid-a-new-battle-royale-right-now/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNET wrote in October.</span></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a fun time, indeed, that&#8217;s entirely on the blockchain. Blink, and you might miss it, but Off The Grid is a native web3 title built upon an Avalanche subnet. This enables crypto capabilities alongside gameplay, including a forthcoming token and the NFT minting and trading of in-game weapons and skins on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/opensea/\">OpenSea</a>. The best part? So far, players aren&#8217;t obligated to engage with these features. The blockchain and the game are separate yet complementary, with the former intended to enhance the latter rather than override it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s a similar story over on Telegram. Players are flocking to the simplicity and engagement of clicker games inside the chat platform. Thanks to endorsing <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/telegram-open-network/\">The Open Network (TON)</a> as its official web3 infrastructure and integrating wallet functionality, Telegram makes it easy for gamers to embrace crypto without knowing it. Gone are complicated onboarding and clunky interfaces. Telegram&#8217;s mini-app gaming occurs automatically inside the known and trusted chat platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The successes are impressive across the board. TON clicker <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/notcoin/\">Notcoin</a> and its eponymous token rose to a market cap of more than half a billion dollars, and BANANA earned 12 million players just over a month after launch. Meanwhile, Off The Grid is also gaining serious traction, with millions of wallets created during the first week of early access before becoming the top free game on the Epic Games Store. The numbers tell a clear story: mass adoption follows when blockchain integration is invisible.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The lesson for blockchain game makers</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the sector&#8217;s inception, we&#8217;ve been waiting for the blockchain gaming &#8220;mainstream moment.&#8221; The one-two punch of Off The Grid and Telegram suggests we&#8217;re inching closer, but their wins hold essential lessons for developers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, arming your game with blockchain isn&#8217;t enough. </span><strong><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/heres-why-31-of-blockchains-games-were-shuttered-in-2023/\">About 400 crypto games</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stopped development last year, and since 2018, more than </span><strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/three-quarters-web3-blockchain-games-failed-last-five-years-coingecko\">three-quarters of all blockchain games</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have failed to gain traction and been discontinued. The reason? Games weren&#8217;t fun enough, and blockchain features weren&#8217;t compelling enough. Going forward, game makers must start with both the game and the blockchain use case before working backward. Without a good game behind it, the blockchain elements never have a chance to take off.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second lesson is about accessibility. </span><strong><a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/onboarding-crypto-adoption-challenges\">One-quarter of web3 leaders agree</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the learning curve for blockchain technology and the lack of user-friendly interfaces remain significant hurdles to adoption. Solutions like </span><strong><a href=\"https://protocol.carv.io/identity\">CARV ID</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are instructive here, uniting gamer profiles under one banner to improve interoperability and showcase achievements across games. This new crop of games shows that we need to start with great gameplay, make it easy to access, and bake blockchain into the foundation. This is the best way to make both sides of &#8220;blockchain gaming&#8221; work together.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my view, it&#8217;s time to think of blockchain gaming like cloud computing\u2014something consumers seldom encounter, but that drives the backend thanks to invisible integration. Just as we don&#8217;t think about cloud computing when using Netflix, players shouldn&#8217;t have to think about blockchain when inside our games.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Balancing gameplay and blockchain in 2025</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading into the new year, blockchain gaming is better positioned to break into the mainstream. AAA studios are taking us seriously, and gamers are coming around the idea of blockchain features that further the play experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there&#8217;s a fine line between creating a great game and ensuring meaningful crypto synergy. Neopets Metaverse, an NFT-powered game based on the massively popular 1999 pet simulator, was in development for roughly two years before it was abruptly canceled. The reason? The CEO said gamers </span><a href=\"https://decrypt.co/151644/neopets-fans-care-less-about-crypto-ceo-says\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;<strong>didn&#8217;t care</strong>&#8220;</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about blockchain, with the title intended to repurpose it as a regular mobile game. Clearly, the game needs to be good, and adding blockchain needs to make sense, add value, and improve the ecosystem.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here, understanding the audience is crucial. Gamers trend younger and want better ways to express themselves, own their identities, and make money online \u2013 all things blockchain can enable. Therefore, making these features accessible and meaningful with blockchain will drive the next web3 gaming bull run.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the challenge for our sector in 2025 \u2013 making blockchain relevant to the game, invisible to the player, and powerful enough to drive adoption. It&#8217;s now up to us \u2013 the developers \u2013 to get there. Off The Grid and Telegram are showing us the way forward \u2013 put blockchain in the background and let the games lead the charge.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/the-gaming-lesson-from-off-the-grid-and-telegram-put-blockchain-in-the-background/\">The gaming lesson from Off The Grid and Telegram?

In the letter signed by Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith, the organization outlined five priorities for the first 100 days of Trump&#8217;s administration.</p>\n<p>While the whole of crypto industry has been calling for a replacement of <a href=\"http://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler\">Gary Gensler</a>, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman, Smith believes that to be insufficient. According to Smith, an overhaul of the leadership at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury Department is also required.</p>\n<p>The SEC is an independent agency and as President Trump will not have the authority to fire Gensler\u2014something he promised to do on his first day back at the White House during his campaign. However, earlier this week, Gensler <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-to-step-down-on-jan-20/\">announced</a> that he will be stepping down from his role to make way for Trump&#8217;s replacement on Jan. 20, 2025, the same day that Trump is scheduled to retake the White House.</p>\n<p>According to the letter, the taxation of digital assets has been inconsistent and the &#8216;Broker rule&#8217; recently introduced by the IRS may drive companies offshore. In July 2024, the IRS <a href=\"https://www.bdo.com/insights/tax/irs-adopts-final-digital-asset-tax-reporting-rules-with-some-revisions#:~:text=The%20final%20regulations%20require%20%E2%80%9Cbrokers,(see%202025%20draft%20form).\">mandated</a> that all brokers are required to disclose gross proceeds as well as gains and losses from selling crypto, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>\n<p>The letter also stated that the Treasury Department needs to be welcoming to software developers and prioritize privacy of U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>Smith also called for Trump to roll back the SAB 121 accounting guideline that requires listed companies to count crypto assets in their balance sheets. In the letter, Smith called the guideline &#8216;punitive&#8217; and &#8216;anti-crypto.&#8217;</p>\n<p>The letter listed the establishment of a &#8216;fit-for-purpose&#8217; regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies among the suggested priorities. The regulations should strike a balance between protecting customers and encouraging innovation, the letter stated.</p>\n<p>Smith further wrote that crypto companies have long been denied access to traditional banking and called for an end to the practice.

        "content": "<p><em>The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist.</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a> pushed the financial innovation envelope in many directions. As a distributed digital ledger, it opened up space for transparency and offered a viable alternative to banking. Relying on its proof-of-work algorithm, Bitcoin established digital scarcity. Digital but still anchored to the physical world of hardware assets and energy requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this while being open-source. And Bitcoin\u2019s open-source nature birthed over a hundred hard forks. These are ledgers governed under different rulesets, so much so that they are incompatible with previous blocks, resulting in a new blockchain version.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a new hard fork is created, propelled by different visions of P2P money and incentives, a new version of Bitcoin is born. By market cap, the largest ones are <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/\">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin-sv/\">Bitcoin SV (BSV)</a>, Bitcoin XT (BTCXT) and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin-gold/\">Bitcoin Gold (BTG)</a>. Although none of them come even close to the massive Bitcoin (BTC) market cap of $1.47 trillion, they have injected many ideas that are relevant to Bitcoin\u2019s future.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>What Are Bitcoin Forks All About?\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the very onset of Bitcoin mainnet launch in January 2009, with the first mined genesis block, it became apparent that changes will have to take place to make Bitcoin </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For that kind of vision to work in the world of near-instant online payments, Bitcoin\u2019s network would have to perform on par with Visa or Mastercard networks. The problem is, those networks rely on centralized databases (ledgers), such as VisaNet, emphasizing efficiency in transaction processing above all else.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, as a money intermediary between banks, Visa is not concerned with any kind of financial sovereignty, in contrast to Bitcoin\u2019s vision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how would that be possible with a decentralized computer network? To remain so, each transaction has to be verified by other nodes to arrive at the proof-of-work consensus. Bitcoin\u2019s current performance is around 7 transactions per second, as it takes 10 minutes to confirm each block stuffed with transactions (</span><strong><a href=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transactions_per_block\">3,347 transactions</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per block at present).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several implications of this approach to ledger management:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the increase in transactions, Bitcoin transaction fees go up. Bitcoin miners inject this friction because they get to set the new level of fee priority in the </span><strong><a href=\"https://mempool.space/\">available Bitcoin mempool space</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as the demand for the Bitcoin mining network increases.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the popularity of Bitcoin increases transaction fees, it makes Bitcoin a poor substitute for \u201cdaily money\u201d which ideally should have minimal friction to be adopted at mass scale.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the obvious solution of increasing transaction block sizes is implemented, the Bitcoin network would get more centralized because more computing and storage would be required to process transactions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, Bitcoin hard forks have been mainly concerned with the balancing act of block sizes. Case in point, when Mike Hearn launched Bitcoin XT as a fork of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/bitcoin-core/\">Bitcoin Core</a> in August 2015, this version of Bitcoin was supposed to increase block size from 1 MB to eventually 8 MB, which could double further every two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we take a look at other Bitcoin hard forks, we see a similar pattern of failure.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>How Are Hard Forks Created?</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin hard forks are created by the introduction of new Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). Alongside bug fixes, they are the staging ground for new features. However, those new features are implemented only if an activation threshold is reached, constituting ~95% miner support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effectively, the last 2,016 blocks (about two weeks of mining) would have to signal their support for a new BIP to be implemented.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Mike Hearn and Gavin Anderson introduced their </span><strong><a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0101\">BIP 101</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> proposal to increase maximum block size, from 1 MB to 8 MB,\u00a0 it failed to pass the activation threshold. This caused some controversy as Hearn declared that \u201cBitcoin has failed\u201d, but only his BIP 101 failed. The resulting hard fork, Bitcoin XT, is the aborted version.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forks like these lead to new coins, </span><strong><a href=\"https://coinspaid.com/knowledge-base/token-vs-coin-settling-the-score/\">unlike tokens</a></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; the latter of which are often created on pre-existing blockchains. In turn, it was Bitcoin Classic (BXC) that subsequently emerged from Bitcoin XT, as the block size was reverted from XT\u2019s 8 MB to 2 MB. Once again, this showcases that Bitcoin hard forks manifest the balancing act of block sizes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From these \u201cblock wars\u201d, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also emerged in August 2017, having eventually increased block size to 32 MB. Out of all the hard fork, BCH remains the most successful one, presently at a $7.26 billion market cap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even such moderately successful splits have their own forks. Australian entrepreneur <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/craig-wright/\">Craig Wright</a> introduced a BCH fork called Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) a year later, in November 2018. Claiming to be the person behind the pseudonym <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/satoshi-nakamoto/\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, he was later revealed as a fraud in the UK High Court, having leveraged extensive forgery and lawfare tactics against critics.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Forged In the Crucible of Adversity</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given that Gavin Anderson was once a key member of Bitcoin Core, the primary framework for Bitcoin, it is fair to say that even failed BIP contributions in the form of hard forks serve their purpose.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Block Size Wars ended up on the side of \u201csmall blockers\u201d, the contested debate did result in Segregated Witness (SegWit) implementation as a soft fork, having been activated at block 477,120 in August 2017.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through BIPs 91, 141, and 148, SegWit made Bitcoin transactions more efficient by segregating witness metadata from the main transaction. This effectively increased the block size by introducing block weight, which allowed for 4x more transactions per block.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_453397\" style=\"width: 1450px;\"><img alt=\"Adoption progress of SegWit\" class=\"wp-image-453397 size-full\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bitbobtc.jpg\" width=\"1450\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-453397\">Adoption progress of SegWit as Bitcoin\u2019s soft fork feature. Image credit: BiTBO</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">Most importantly, SegWit paved the road for Bitcoin\u2019s own layer 2 scaling solution, Lightning Network, because it enabled Schnorr signatures. These not only make it possible to have Atomic Multi-Path Payments (<a href=\"https://docs.lightning.engineering/lightning-network-tools/lnd/amp\"><span class=\"s1\">AMP</span></a>) for LN, which splits large payments into tiny bits, but they minimize on-chain data footprint with more efficient, smaller signatures.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The AMP feature also allows users to optimize payment routing through LN channels, as the payer only has to know the public key of the recipient. Ultimately, what started as a series of Bitcoin hard forks, with most failing to gain traction, facilitated another type of Bitcoin scaling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The frictionless scaling enabled by LN, combined with smart contracts, may even lead to <a href=\"https://highstrike.com/what-is-futures-trading/\"><span class=\"s1\">futures contracts</span></a> indirectly, as they would require such speed and deeper liquidity. Even the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland recognized that Lightning Network gets Bitcoin closer to \u201cdaily money\u201d in the <a href=\"https://download.ssrn.com/22/06/21/ssrn_id4142590_code882697.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=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&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20241107T101214Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAUPUUPRWEZOMADLJR/20241107/us-east-1/s3/aws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=9683064db7f7f9754ec50cf29ace5370db190eb7887fc23d1e2007fab5496773&amp;abstractId=4142590\"><span class=\"s1\">paper</span></a> titled <i>The Lightning Network: Turning Bitcoin into Money.</i></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p3\">\u201cOur findings suggest that the off-chain netting benefits of the Lightning Network can help Bitcoin to scale and function better as a means of payment. Centralization of the Lightning Network does not appear to make it much more efficient, though it may increase the proportion of low fee transactions.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the payments arena, it may be likely that specialized hard forks could find their niche. There is always a need for online <a href=\"https://www.fundthrough.com/blog/ask-fundthrough/invoice-financing-vs-factoring-cash-flow-solutions-for-smbs/\"><span class=\"s1\">invoice factoring</span></a> or obtaining trade credit for small to medium business (SMBs).</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">But the fact that Bitcoin remained with a conservative block size while adding LN as a scaling solution is not that surprising in hindsight.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\">Security Risks and Network Vulnerabilities</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the initial stages of Bitcoin\u2019s development and adoption, as a major monetary novelty, it was vital to maintain a conservative approach. If the public is to perceive Bitcoin as sound money, it has to maintain core features, no pun intended.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Inherently, by diluting the hash rate power, hard forks introduce a security vulnerability. The underlying value of Bitcoin comes from the mining network\u2019s hash rate power. It is the measure of calculations needed for mining rigs to solve cryptographic puzzles and add a valid transaction block, in return for BTC as block reward.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">During this mining competition, those with higher hashrate have a greater chance to earn BTC. And as more computing power is added to the network, Bitcoin\u2019s network difficulty auto-adjusts every 2,016 blocks, or around two weeks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Conversely, a drop in hash rate power would make it more likely for a <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/explained-51-percent-attacks-on-bitcoin-cryptocurrencies/\"><span class=\"s1\">51% network attack</span></a> attempt to succeed. A new hard fork would not only siphon away computing power, but this divergence and dilution would create a heightened state of risk during the new version rollout.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">What this amounts to is that Bitcoin miners are biased toward network security over innovation.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">After all, even if there is a single publicized instance of a successful hack of the Bitcoin network, this would serve as a value-deflating force in perpetuity. And if that happens, any innovation would take a back seat. Accordingly, the Bitcoin hashrate has only one trajectory &#8211; up.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_453398\" style=\"width: 1276px;\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Hashrate\" class=\"wp-image-453398 size-full\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/coinwarz.jpg\" width=\"1276\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-453398\">Bitcoin Hashrate (Image credit: CoinWarz)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">At this point in time, Bitcoin mainnet\u2019s computing power is so abundant that even a severe BTC price drop would not represent a vulnerability. In such a scenario, it is possible that some mining operations could <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-file-chapter-11-bankruptcy-cnbc-2022-12-21/\"><span class=\"s1\">exit the network</span></a> due to losses, thus ending up lowering the mining difficulty.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">But due to prior conservative approach and bias toward security, the Bitcoin network would weather it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\">Market Volatility and Investor Sentiment</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">Seven years ago, the aforementioned Bitcoin Cash (BCH) had its all-time high price of $4,355, as the most successful hard fork launch. Having launched in August 2017, the peak happened at the end of that year. Following the fate of many altcoins, alongside Bitcoin SV, the pattern is familiar:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">Initial speculative boost.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">More distant, ever lower price peaks from the previous ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_453399\" style=\"width: 1313px;\"><img alt=\"Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin SV\" class=\"wp-image-453399 size-full\" height=\"1167\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bch-bsv.jpg\" width=\"1313\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-453399\">Bitcoin Cash vs. Bitcoin SV (Image credit: CoinMarketCap)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">Notably, during the period of +$6 trillion M2 money supply boost by the Federal Reserve in 2020 and 2021, alongside stimulus checks, both hard forks mirrored that spike. But after the liquidity spigot was turned off with the beginning of the interest rate hiking cycle in March 2022, BSV and BCH returned to high risk-off territory.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This makes sense considering the following factors:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">In total, there is only so much capital to go around.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">There is even less capital in the crypto sphere.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">As digital monetary novelty, cryptocurrencies are perceived as riskier than stocks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p3\">Consequently, the beneficiary of most capital would go to the original and most secure cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p4\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">As this valuation pattern becomes more apparent, it is exceedingly unlikely that future Bitcoin hard forks, or existing ones, would gain traction over Bitcoin. In the eyes of investors, altcoins are juxtaposed against stocks which are based on companies with hard assets and earnings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The original Bitcoin is the exception here, precisely because of its vast computing network that brings hard assets into play. Although hard forks attempted the same, they pale in comparison, which levels them with generic proof-of-stake altcoins.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Within that ecosystem, heavyweights like ethereum have become the center of capital gravity. At best, Bitcoin hard forks could receive a momentary price boost, due to their lower market caps compared to Bitcoin. This holds speculative potential for profit, but the same holds true for the altcoin ecosystem as a whole.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/are-bitcoin-forks-advancing-progress-or-threatening-stability/\">Are Bitcoin forks advancing progress or threatening stability?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

According to VanEck, this mirrors the market&#8217;s behavior in late 2020, when Bitcoin doubled after the US presidential election and continued its upward trajectory in the subsequent year.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a pro-Bitcoin regulatory environment and growing institutional interest, VanEck believes the next phase of the bull market is underway.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Metrics signal bullish sentiment</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VanEck analyzed perpetual futures funding rates as a measure of market sentiment, and the results show that elevated rates above 10% often coincide with significant short \u2014 to medium-term gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Nov. 12, funding rates have consistently exceeded this threshold, a pattern reminiscent of prior bull market phases.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The report stated:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>&#8220;Historically, sustained high funding rates indicate heightened bullish momentum.&#8221;\u00a0</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it also cautioned that elevated rates often signal cycle tops over more extended time frames.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the report examined Relative Unrealized Profit (RUP), which measures unrealized gains in the market. Current 30-day moving average RUP levels are approximately 0.54, well below the 0.70 threshold typically associated with market tops.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VanEck noted that RUP levels between 0.60 and 0.70 offer the most favorable conditions for short- to medium-term trades.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Retail interest rises</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VanEck observed that retail interest remains below historical peaks as measured by <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/google/\">Googl</a>e searches for &#8220;crypto&#8221; and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/\">Coinbase&#8217;s</a> App Store ranking.

Some crypto is not even a security at all, but we need to make it clear whether or not you would fall within SEC jurisdiction or not.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a token offering falls under the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction, clear guidelines are necessary so crypto firms can decide the right course of action to comply with the regulator&#8217;s rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uyeda also defended the creation of &#8220;safe harbors,&#8221; which are regulatory sandboxes where crypto companies could experiment with different products, allowing &#8220;innovation to occur.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SEC Commissioner also argued that regulators must work with Congress and other federal agencies to create a cohesive approach to crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, considering <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler/\">Gary Gensler</a> will step down as the SEC Chair on Jan. 20, Uyeda was asked if he is interested in filling the role, and he answered that this is a decision for the President.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Tokenized funds as collateral</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uyeda&#8217;s call for reform comes amid a wider regulatory shift toward crypto and blockchain technology in finance. The CFTC recently recommended using tokenized funds as collateral.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Bloomberg News <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/cftc-advisers-recommend-use-of-tokenized-assets-as-collateral\">reported</a> on Nov. 22 that the Global Markets Advisory Committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved using tokenized assets, such as money-market fund tokens launched by <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/blackrock/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BlackRock</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/franklin-templeton/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Franklin Templeton</a>, as collateral for derivatives trading</span>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The committee&#8217;s recommendation, which now awaits review by the CFTC, highlights the potential for distributed ledger technology (DLT) to enhance the efficiency and transparency of collateral management.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The advisory panel\u2019s recommendation provides a framework for registered firms to hold and transfer tokenized non-cash collateral using distributed-ledger technology.
