To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk to Solana ecosystem people, I\u2019ll sometimes ask what new projects they\u2019ve been hearing about. One such project that\u2019s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren\u2019t useful if they aren\u2019t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation\u2019s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren\u2019t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example \u2014 the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren\u2019t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins \u201cget there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform\u2019s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan\u2019s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem\u2019s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana\u2019s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Some crypto is not even a security at all, but we need to make it clear whether or not you would fall within SEC jurisdiction or not.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a token offering falls under the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction, clear guidelines are necessary so crypto firms can decide the right course of action to comply with the regulator&#8217;s rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uyeda also defended the creation of &#8220;safe harbors,&#8221; which are regulatory sandboxes where crypto companies could experiment with different products, allowing &#8220;innovation to occur.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SEC Commissioner also argued that regulators must work with Congress and other federal agencies to create a cohesive approach to crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, considering <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler/\">Gary Gensler</a> will step down as the SEC Chair on Jan. 20, Uyeda was asked if he is interested in filling the role, and he answered that this is a decision for the President.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Tokenized funds as collateral</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uyeda&#8217;s call for reform comes amid a wider regulatory shift toward crypto and blockchain technology in finance.
