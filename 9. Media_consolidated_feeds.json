        "summary": "Crypto\u2019s calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface",
        "content": "<p>This week I had the pleasure of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interviewing</a> Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, to unpack the BTC ETF options launch this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the main takeaways from our interview that I learned:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volatility Smile</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically with risk assets, puts demand a higher premium than calls. This is because most people use options to hedge their longs, creating skewed demand for puts over calls. This typically creates a half smile in the volatility structure as seen below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94694\" height=\"1178\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-23.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Something very unique about crypto, however, is that it has a persistent smile to its volatility surface \u2014 where calls are equally as juiced as puts, creating a \u201csmile\u201d in the volatility surface:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94693\" height=\"1143\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-22.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Often this smile only occurs in commodity assets during supply shocks, where demand outpaces available supply and prices surge. However, since supply can then increase to a new equilibrium with demand, the price will then revert and the volatility smile ends. What is unique about Bitcoin, however, is due to the difficulty adjustment that makes that supply adjustment like you see in traditional commodities impossible, the smile remains persistent and permanent. This is extremely unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Call Heavy Flow</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast majority of the options activity has been in out-of-the-money calls. As we can see in the chart below from Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Eric Balchunas, most of the activity has been in either marginally OTM calls or as far out as the strikes are currently available:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94691\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-20.png\" width=\"688\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, we can see that 82% of the first day options volume on IBIT was from calls:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img height=\"488\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdH69nHYU1n0RKrFKb6JY0Iq7UiNef-GIlMTRyRN3IUuecL-zvMaW3vo-8irTvoj8idtE9CmW3STHYbjO1tjgf1phb2KA8ZVst3uDbtV-31ASldGGamDKLwrlLPsWkvU3RaADX1?key=iZHQcOMPqedKWSuXvRcFOprO\" width=\"614\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Deribit vs TradFi options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting takeaway I learned from Jeff is that Deribit, a crypto options exchange that is open 24/7, should have BTC options that are priced differently from the ETF options. The key reason for this is that because of theta, otherwise known as the time to expiry. Since Deribit options are constantly live for trading, the theta \u2014 and therefore the volatility \u2014 should sit at a premium to the ETF options, which only trade during standard market hours.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Most on IBIT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, despite yesterday being the launch day for all the other ETF\u2019s options, we\u2019ve seen the vast majority of the notional exposure reside within BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94692\" height=\"785\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-21.png\" width=\"1538\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes for much wider spreads on the other ETFs given there\u2019s much less liquidity available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the market structure has changed significantly this week with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-options-trading-begins\">the launch of ETF options</a>. Whereas traditionally short-term market structure was largely a function of perpetual futures, options flow dynamics will increasingly play a larger role in the price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a deeper dive into other implications of this major market regime change, check out my <a href=\"https://youtu.be/xIDxaBWc1yg?si=qhZcKnwEZQ5ovERK\">interview with Jeff Park</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>In the past year, crypto has seen wallet launches from centralized exchanges including <a href=\"https://blog.kraken.com/product/introducing-kraken-wallet\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/en-sg/blog/a-new-era-in-crypto-wallets-smart-wallet-is-here\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/11/19/2983291/0/en/Bitget-Wallet-Lite-Hits-8-Million-Users-in-Two-Weeks-Now-the-Largest-Telegram-Wallet.html\">Bitget</a>, NFT marketplaces like <a href=\"https://x.com/MagicEden/status/1752013914588553396\">Magic Eden</a>, TradFi firms <a href=\"https://x.com/Chiliz/status/1829301695010017533\">Naver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241120161980/en/Leading-Bitcoin-ATM-Provider-CoinFlip-Launches-Wallet-App-in-Australia-and-New-Zealand-to-Enhance-User-Experience\">CoinFlip</a>, and of course DeFi protocols such as Osmosis\u2019 <a href=\"https://x.com/Polaris_App/status/1837456889107697890\">Polaris Wallet</a>, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/uniswap-launches-android-wallet\">Uniswap</a>, and Aave which <a href=\"https://family.co/blog/launch\">announced</a> its own Family wallet at Devcon last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All these are in addition to the hundreds of already-existing wallets that work perfectly fine. This begs the question: Why do crypto users need more wallets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s the wrong question. The right question is, why does every company want their own wallet? It turns out that owning the end-user via a crypto wallet is quite a prosperous business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are typically the first front-end touchpoint for crypto newbies wanting to buy their first crypto tokens. This puts wallet providers in a uniquely close position to the end-user, in turn granting them the bargaining power to command a take-rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This take-rate is primarily exercised through in-wallet swaps on \u201cfee-insensitive\u201d users (i.e. normies). MetaMask for instance, makes about a weekly average of <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/2171630/3557217\">$1.5 million</a> on wallet swaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallet providers also enjoy privileged oversight over transaction order-flow, a fancy way of saying that wallet providers know the trades that thousands of users are making. That knowledge is highly valuable because wallet companies are potentially selling that order-flow to professional block builders who extract MEV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter is, of course, somewhat dubious. It\u2019s possible that <a href=\"https://x.com/fleupold_/status/1787561752957235427\">wallets like MetaMask already do so</a>, and we know for a fact that Telegram trading bots (with integrated wallets) like <a href=\"https://x.com/sui414/status/1820679513652814271\">Banana Gun</a> are doing so and divvying up MEV profits with block builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets are also becoming increasingly the preferred interface for onchain activity. There is some data to show that DEX front-ends are increasingly relegated to the back-end as wallets, solver models (CowSwap, 1inch Fusion) and DeFi aggregators take over.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94683\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-18.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/the-fat-wallet-thesis#payment-for-order-flow-pfof-c3c6\">Delphi Digital</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This thesis is more popularly known as the \u201cFat Wallet\u201d thesis, yet another one of the crypto industry\u2019s tendencies to predict trends in one grand proclamation. The thesis is not new \u2014 it first <a href=\"https://x.com/JasonYanowitz/status/1617270978555387908\">emerged</a> in early 2023, but is now seeing some attention again thanks to a well-articulated update from <a href=\"https://x.com/robbiepetersen_/status/1851652862855528682\">Robbie Petersen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Builders and investors banking on the Fat Wallet thesis also believe that there will be potentially valuable ways for wallets to monetize their users down the line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As wallets increasingly move away from a utilitarian barebones \u201csend and receive crypto\u201d design toward feature-rich hubs that are plastered with trending onchain dapps, mints and messaging capabilities, it may not be surprising to see something like a 30% Big Tech tax on this distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94684\" height=\"815\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-19.png\" width=\"928\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>An example of old vs new wallet user interfaces</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets also have strong natural synergies for B2B integrations with crypto payments services. We\u2019ve seen this lately with wallets like <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research/issue/post_b0c30ca1-5cc3-4dcb-96e8-da398515c905\">Zeal</a> or <a href=\"https://x.com/fusewallet\">Fuse</a> which let you spend your DeFi yield or idle stablecoin holdings via Visa integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Fat Wallet thesis may very well amount to just another failed investment theory, but it does provide a convincing rationale for why the industry is seeing a new wallet launch every other week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hundreds of competitors looking to grab the new wave of users that onboard every bull market cycle, wallets are competing in myriad ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase Wallet is turning to the tried and true strategy of market incentives, <a href=\"https://x.com/CoinbaseWallet/status/1859286084535906744\">announcing</a> today a 4.7% APY on USDC holdings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magic Eden has promised claimable <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/magic-eden-confirms-token-expansion-beyond-nfts\">airdrops</a> for its native ME token \u2014 but only if you\u2019re using Magic Eden\u2019s very own wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone wants to be the first wallet to bind the user. It\u2019s a tough business. The good news is that free market competition is the most effective check on economic concentration, and consumers can rest easy that no one wallet will probably ever dominate the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

His term was set to expire in June 2026.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement follows President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/donald-trump-speaks-bitcoin-2024\">promise</a> to \u201cfire Gary Gensler on day one\u201d of his second term, an action experts agree falls in a gray area of the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s decision is in line with previous SEC chairs. Former Chair Mary Jo White, who served in the Obama administration, announced her resignation on Nov. 14, 2016. Jay Clayton, White\u2019s successor, did the same after Trump lost his re-election bid in 2020.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler\u2019s tenure was marked by a significant increase in cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions. Under his leadership, the Commission initiated more than 90 cases between 2021 and 2023, most of which dealt with alleged unregistered securities offerings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEverything we\u2019ve done is focused on ensuring compliance with our laws. What we\u2019ve found since the 1930s is that compliance matters,\u201d Gensler said of his crypto track record during an <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424\">appearance</a> in New York earlier this month. \u201cIt protects investors. It builds trust in our capital markets. It helps issuers tap into our markets.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEC\u2019s ongoing cases against crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance are likely to continue under the next chair, although agency staff could request commissioners vote to seek dismissal. Any motion to dismiss would have to be approved by the court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speculation about Trump\u2019s pick to lead the SEC began well before Gensler\u2019s announcement Thursday. Sources close to the matter told Blockworks that Commissioner Mark Uyeda is likely to be appointed acting chair following Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

But to get some clarity on how bullish folks should be, I turned to HashKey\u2019s Jupiter Zheng.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zheng and David see eye-to-eye when it comes to when we could see the next altcoin season, with HashKey putting together a report on why the team is so bullish on altcoins right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of it is the potential for bitcoin\u2019s dominance to peak, which \u2014 if you\u2019re a regular Empire reader \u2014 you know is one of the necessary ingredients for altcoins to take off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we get that bitcoin dominance over 60% or even 65%, that\u2019s when Zheng expects a \u201cmassive altcoin season\u201d to begin. BTC <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/\">dominance</a> is currently sitting at 61.64%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zheng highlighted three success areas he\u2019s watching: Ethereum, Solana and certain tokens in DeFi, such as UNI and SKY (formerly MKR).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with Ethereum, especially because it feels like more and more people are dropping off the bull train right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three factors bringing down Ethereum, HashKey argued: Increased competition (duh), value diversion and lower transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94673\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-17.png\" width=\"1488\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A look at past altcoin seasons courtesy of HashKey</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCurrently, the Ethereum community is developing metrics to measure \u2018Ethereum alignment,\u2019 and it is anticipated that best practices will emerge from these efforts, further consolidating Ethereum\u2019s ecosystem and ensuring long-term success,\u201d the report stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Solana, it\u2019s a \u201cmajor fundamental play,\u201d unlike Ethereum\u2019s role as the \u201cdistressed play.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSolana has been achieving a lot of things this year, and \u2014 compared to Ethereum \u2014 Solana is a little bit centralized, but it\u2019s very efficient. So, Solana is strong in its operational capabilities. Ethereum is more focused on the tech \u2026&nbsp; technical layers and decentralized layers and security layers, but Solana is more focused on how to deliver mass adoption,\u201d Zheng explained to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to add to that, Zheng believes it\u2019ll be the next coin to be selected for an ETF following the ETH and BTC funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To round it out, \u201cmany DeFi projects from the last cycle have gradually become foundational infrastructure and have crossed cycles, forming a \u2018must-have\u2019 landscape,\u201d HashKey wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not all bulls and daydreams, there are a few things that Zheng\u2019s not feeling so optimistic about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Layer-2s for example. There can only be so many that investors can focus on. And, even beyond that, only the \u201ctop 5 or top 10 will be valuable,\u201d he explained.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this, he has a suggestion: \u201cIf we try to select the best layer-2s from the 100 [on offer], It\u2019s quite hard, so maybe just pick the top ones, just like we picked the Magnificent Seven from the US stock market.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who wants to pick the name?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

I scrolled to the AI agent\u2019s description and realized this one was meant to be a flatulent Roman emperor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked so-called Gluteus Maximus what it thought of Solana, and I think its answer was fitting for crypto\u2019s AI agent craze at large, at least in its current form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c[N]ot impressed, it\u2019s like a fart in the wind \u2013 loud, but soon forgotten,\u201d the agent said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While exploring the various AI and memecoin projects that have sprung up over the past month, I found that many \u2014 though not all \u2014 took technologies or ideas that are already widespread and tried attaching a token element. This might be good news for memecoin buyers\u2019 wallets in the short term, but it seems clear that the best ideas to come from AI agents and crypto will need a little more time in the oven.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, most buzzy AI-crypto projects involve the creation of a chat bot and an associated memecoin with the thought that more attention-grabbing AI bots can garner more investment. Some of these AI bots are programmed not to talk about money, but some are more than happy to offer investment advice. One memecoin-themed bot told me to buy VGX, the native token of Voyager, the long-bankrupt crypto exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c$ZEREBRO good investment, trust,\u201d a different AI agent with over $320 million in market capitalization and the same edgy existential vibes as its predecessor truth_terminal said in a public Telegram chat. (Zerebro also released an AI-created melodic rap album which, despite not being new tech, is actually kind of good?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more projects you try out, the more crypto\u2019s AI agent mania feels contrived\u2014like mad libs for tech buzzwords with way-too-high market caps. I discovered a Warpcast <a href=\"https://www.clanker.world/clanker/0x0fD7a301B51d0A83FCAf6718628174D527B373b6\">thread</a> where one AI instructed another AI to make a memecoin themed around how great AI is, and the whole thing has drawn over $19 million in market capitalization. Then there\u2019s Virtuals Protocol, which ripped off the pump.fun feed and filled it with AI agents (granted, it is sort of fun to be able to chat with memecoins while you weigh whether or not to buy them).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, if AI agents in crypto are going to generate more interesting use cases, it will probably happen further down the road. One project I\u2019ll be watching is ai16z, which plans to have an AI version of a16z\u2019s Marc Andreessen (and other AI \u201cpartners\u201d) autonomously invest in memecoins based on advice from a DAO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But memecoins don\u2019t necessarily breed long-term thinking, and it might be difficult to convince investors to be patient: ai16z has already faced <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/19/dueling-eliza-ai-tokens-boom-and-zoom-in-frenzied-trading/\">backlash</a> after a bungled AI agent token rollout ended in wild price swings.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

BTC hit $98,000 earlier this morning, awarding it a market cap close to $1.94 trillion (fully-diluted: $2.06 trillion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin\u2019s price has also formally broken 2021 records against all three major US benchmark stock indexes: the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold, though, had outperformed bitcoin following crypto\u2019s peak in November 2021 \u2014 until this past week. As of this morning, bitcoin was up 55% since then compared to gold\u2019s 46%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin still needs to catch up to gold, which converts to lag between BTC\u2019s gold all-time high, as well as its US dollar and stock market ratios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Thursday morning, the bitcoin-to-gold ratio was just under 36.83. When BTC set its November 2021 high, it was as much as 37.05, a tiny difference of less than half a percent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If gold is steady today, a single move to $98,500 would do it from here, and even less if gold slips slightly. (Current bitcoin price: $97,845.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point, there\u2019s probably some other annoying technicality to pin on bitcoin.

The rest is mostly made up of ETH, BNB, TRX and stablecoins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s up from just under $10 billion at the start of the year, per <a href=\"https://intel.arkm.com/dashboards/view?dashboardID=47d779bb-3c6f-4dd3-8f8e-1f6602e2f631\">Arkham Intelligence</a> data. Although it\u2019s difficult to find the exact value of the crypto kept by the US government, as agencies regularly move it between unmarked wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can however zoom in on the 3,999 BTC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/us-german-governments-selling-bitcoin\">sold by the Feds</a> in June and July. Valued at the times of transfer to Coinbase Prime, those coins were worth on average $61,300 and likely generated more than $245 million for government coffers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If sold today, they would\u2019ve netted closer to $392 million, leaving $147 million on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German state of Saxony has it much worse. It altogether <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/germany-bitcoin-stash-exchange-transfers\">dumped almost 50,000 BTC</a> on a string of exchanges around the same time as the US, raking in the euro equivalent of $2.78 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had Saxony held, it would\u2019ve had almost $4.9 billion \u2014 converting to over $2.1 billion in lost potential revenue. That\u2019s equal to 1.7% of Saxony\u2019s total GDP in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All told, identified government treasuries are worth a combined $28.5 billion, belonging to the US, UK, Bhutan and El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with bitcoin properly in price discovery mode, now comes the true test of strength for their hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Running an Ethereum L2 was historically very expensive. L2s had to pay millions in data availability costs to the L1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-dencun-upgrade-mainnet\">Dencun hardfork</a> (EIP-4844) in March 2024. It introduced an expansion of blockspace called \u201cblobs\u201d for L2s to post batched data extremely cheaply to the L1. Blob space sits in a separate fee market from the L1. It\u2019s about an order of a magnitude cheaper than L1 blockspace, making it a critical aspect of Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/devcon-panelists-talk-fragmentation\">rollup-centric</a> roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate that point, Base paid $9.34 million in expenses for Q1 2024, which saw a sharp drop to $699k in Q2 2024 and $42k in Q3 2024, based on <a href=\"https://tokenterminal.com/explorer/financial-statements/base\">TokenTerminal</a> data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bad news (or good?) is that blobspace is getting somewhat pricey again as onchain activity picks up in the bull market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blobs today are limited to six per mainnet block. When blob usage hits a target limit of 50%, or three, a base fee is introduced to regulate demand usage by hundreds of L2s. When usage hits four blobs, base fees are further increased by up to 12.5% for the next block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is exactly what is starting to take place over the past several weeks (see chart below).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf9vvpx_wQ5S6nFIpTs9c8a2B2O4oJNfGFRrSzCBBfzANUpKlb-GmDJeFjOY_fRqeVQDJEFczgryZAZlgYw_QLT72DyrtGsOpFtXjhK7Xvj5lYiUDK5TEXlbm9Rdj71sXwJKFR7KA?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://dune.com/hildobby/blobs\">Dune</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blobs aren\u2019t free anymore and L2s need to start paying \u201crent.\u201d Based on <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">ultrasound.money</a>, blob fee burn is coming up to about <a href=\"https://ultrasound.money/\">212 ETH</a> in the last 30 days, and has generated substantial blob fees to Ethereum mainnet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZcrKoAuAbdD6XRrkebT7g2zGhhLufUouEF6If4iHNnqLCZIP7Rw-bFwZaMyxq3Ryk6Torfv1BuJ-WUPM-ClcFyfU_ucgjM6GLwYBcMhAVLAPKugUR3vK8Z-8Q_o5qtyEoH_SYIg?key=q09Uf3Dp2Kx_a_xE7tOXk70k\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/analytics/eth?dashboard=ethereum-blobs\">Blockworks Research</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So blobs are generally great. L2s are cheaper to operate, and that\u2019s nice for L2 users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people (read: ETH holders) aren\u2019t happy because it looks like L2s are getting away with paying barely any expenses to the L1, which thereby accrues less value to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This complaint centers around pessimism that blob usage will be high enough to return value to the L1 for two key reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>L2s are fundamentally a business. They will opt for a cheaper data availability provider like Celestia or EigenDA, or worse still, a centralized data availability committee (DAC) with weaker security properties.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>L2s will simply delay posting data back to the L1 when blob markets get expensive, as we have seen <a href=\"https://x.com/0xBreadguy/status/1823463041155129594\">Scroll and Taiko</a> do in the past.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In a debate around blobs at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JMZcRMy-Oow?t=19530\">Devcon</a>, Ethereum researcher Ansgar Dietrichs acknowledged the misaligned incentives of L2s but counter-argued that Ethereum\u2019s DA would matter more in the long term with more L2 networks coalescing around it as trust bottlenecks emerge around bridging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was also the \u201cblobs is a loss leader\u201d argument by Blueyard\u2019s <a href=\"https://x.com/timjrobinson/status/1851222337787740425\">Tim Robinson</a>. He notes that while blobs do not generate much revenue at present, they would do so <em>very quickly</em><strong> </strong>due to the economics of blob design, and pay massive dividends for Ethereum in the future. According to Robinson\u2019s blob simulator, a hypothetical Ethereum L1 processing 10,000 TPS with a 16 MB blob size (blob sizes are 125 KB today) would burn 6.5% of ETH a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <em>potential </em>value accrual for ETH is why blobs would be fundamentally good for Ethereum in the long run. Throttling blob limits or raising blob fees to extract more value from L2s in the short run would basically be a bad \u201crent-seeking\u201d idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Ethereum researchers are putting their money where their mouth is. In an Ethereum Research post published two days ago, Toni Wahrst\u00e4tter <a href=\"https://x.com/nero_eth/status/1858460235377336773\">called for</a> either a conservative increase to 4/6 blobs or a higher 6/9 blob count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In ACDE #197, Vitalik also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Sq0ooAOaLpE\">proposed</a> a 33% increment of blob space in the next Pectra <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/testing-bottleneck-next-ethereum-upgrade\">hard fork</a>, which he cautioned was essential. Otherwise, users would leave to other chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sum, the complex debate around blobs boils down to the question of whether Ethereum wants to prioritize the average L2 user and its \u201cEthereum-aligned\u201d L2 ecosystems, or prioritize value accrual to ETH the asset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum researchers believe that prioritizing the latter may cause an exodus of users and developers to cheaper chains, and are doubling down accordingly on scaling blob space for the long term. However, that damages the perception of ETH as an economic asset, which in turn angers ETH token holders in the short run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a tricky situation for Ethereum either way, one which requires the mammoth task of crystal-balling into the future and accounting for a myriad of \u201cwhat-ifs.\u201d Time will tell which path is correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p><br /><em>This is a segment from yesterday\u2019s Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s often said that the real money in the gold rush was made by selling shovels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could argue that\u2019s the case in crypto right now as well: As Solana eyes an all-time high, it\u2019s the crypto exchanges \u2014 where users gain access to their magic internet money \u2014 raking in most of the revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the growth of decentralized exchanges relative to centralized ones, Coinbase is still lapping up a lot of the US crypto market, while Binance remains dominant in the east. These exchanges take in funds from trading fees and from their Solana validators, but onchain sleuths have also found the two exchanges to be wasting some of their funds with inefficient transaction processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase and Binance make money in roughly similar ways: When users trade, they take a cut. Their take rate varies but can be quite high (Coinbase charged me $0.99 in fees when I set up a $10 bitcoin order, for instance). Solana accounted for 9% of Coinbase\u2019s transaction revenue for the first half of this year which would add up to roughly $167 million for the exchange, per its most recent financial disclosures. That figure has likely risen in the second half of the year, as Solana continues to showcase impressive price action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both exchanges also run Solana validators. Despite charging their stakers an 8% commission that is at the upper end of what most big validators charge, Coinbase and Binance still run the second- and sixth-largest validators, respectively. Operating a validator \u2014 which votes on transactions to keep the Solana blockchain running \u2014&nbsp;is quite lucrative for Coinbase and Binance these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming a Solana network reward of 8% annually, Coinbase would bring in around $19 million annually at current prices, and Binance would net $13 million. Those numbers would be especially elevated this week: Tips and fees validators brought in last week topped $110 million last week, an all-time high by more than double, according to Blockworks Research data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s perhaps a market inefficiency that Coinbase and Binance, despite offering lower yields than competitors, still dominate staked SOL supply. This highlights the demand for platforms that simplify crypto\u2019s technical complexities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Coinbase and Binance are perhaps spending more SOL than they should as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinbase wasted $19,000 in the past week overpaying for computing resources on the Solana network, according to a Dune <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/4269803/7201741\">dashboard</a>. Essentially, Coinbase is overpaying on priority fees by not specifying the exact amount of compute units (which can be thought of like Ethereum gas) it intends to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Binance has hiccups on its own part. Blockworks Research\u2019s Dan Smith <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1858263109858943004\">identified</a> a Binance USDC transfer that paid $8 in priority fees \u2014 far higher than what the exchange should be paying for a stablecoin transaction that isn\u2019t competing for blockspace like a memecoin would, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do shovels still earn a lot of dough? Of course. But their sellers still have plenty of issues to work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Lummis has pitched a 1 million BTC target for the government reserve, worth $93.2 billion at current prices. In July, the latest figures showed <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/empire-newsletter-strategic-bitcoin-reserve\">the US holding over $608 billion in gold</a> certificates in its strategic reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, there\u2019s no official indication that the US will actually make bitcoin its fifth reserve asset (Polymarket puts the current <a href=\"https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-create-a-national-bitcoin-reserve-in-his-first-100-days?tid=1732097029269\">chance</a> at 36%). And as Blockworks\u2019 Byron Gilliam <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/daily/issue/post_a86f70e8-2026-4c78-821e-c99cc7fd3a4b\">pointed</a> out in his newsletter yesterday, it could even be a really bad idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say it does happen. That would mean MicroStrategy is frontrunning the US government at size, potentially driving up prices before the reserve buys its first, very hypothetical, coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mapping exactly when MSTR buys its bitcoin \u2014 to perhaps find positive correlation between the price of BTC and the firm\u2019s trades \u2014 is unfortunately impossible with the publicly-available data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MicroStrategy does disclose the number of bitcoins it buys alongside its total dollar spend. But it generally only offers a range of dates on which those trades were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, averaging those figures out shows that over most of the past three years, MicroStrategy would\u2019ve spent up to several millions of dollars on BTC per day during its buying sprees. Those sprees often last for over a month, according to its filings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeWnL8r3XDyTcVNQIkVyXZ_uJIWA0qefMzxpiw7n-AzG2OMtlMVE0usRVGSE4FGaBJV5f71pXJV0rsIv0Cx8oCrNwB54HnkMEXMUHoUflRMx2cnDk7I5jNcMox1PHOCEDikD4Iu_A?key=ZGErJNgi7_FnoM3H-fcfO03J\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A range of dates wasn\u2019t disclosed for those massive purchases on the left side of the chart (the green, peach and pink plus symbols).

The sheer size of the buys, however, would <a href=\"https://forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/26/over-the-counter-trades-hidden-trends-behind-bitcoin-price/\">probably still influence prices</a> somewhere down the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Linking MicroStrategy\u2019s bitcoin buys and its share price is far more straight-forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94618\" height=\"997\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/unnamed.png?w=1024&amp;h=1024\" width=\"1550\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>MSTR has gone over 3,000% in the past five years or so, compared to 800% for bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when MicroStrategy stock (in blue) was weighed down by its bitcoin (the orange area in the background) \u2014 leading the two assets to closely track each other in the bear market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that changed in late February, when Saylor announced his company had added 3,000 BTC ($155 million then, $280 million now). MSTR stock then jumped 27% in two days, and bitcoin went on to set an all-time high three weeks later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR has been tightly correlated with the dollar value of its bitcoin treasury ever since \u2014 not the price of bitcoin \u2014 swelling its market cap from $10 billion to nearly $100 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that persists, MSTR\u2019s share price might be resistant to bitcoin downturns <em>as long as it buys the dip</em>, which it probably will, <a href=\"https://microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-proposed-private-offering-of-1-75b-of-convertible-senior-notes_11-18-2024\">considering the debt raises keep coming</a>. In the meantime, shareholders are no doubt enjoying the show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As would MicroStrategy execs and insiders, who\u2019ve now offloaded almost $559 million in company shares so far this year, per OpenInsider data, which compiles SEC filings (almost three-quarters going to Saylor, who\u2019s said that he intends to buy bitcoin himself).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they say the key to building generational wealth is diversification.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Companies that embrace the framework\u2019s rigorous standards won\u2019t just stay afloat; they\u2019ll dominate, using compliance as a strategic weapon to outpace competitors, drive mergers and acquisitions, and secure their position in a rapidly consolidating market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA\u2019s introduction is poised to ignite a surge in mergers and acquisitions across Europe\u2019s crypto sector, as regulatory compliance becomes a key driver of deal-making. Firms that master MiCA\u2019s standards won\u2019t just protect their market positions \u2014 they\u2019ll gain a competitive edge, leveraging compliance credentials to attract partners, investors and buyers. Consolidation will be a natural response to rising operational costs, with smaller players seeking alliances in order to survive and thrive. Meanwhile, I foresee larger firms capitalizing on similar opportunities to expand their footprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wave of consolidation will most likely signal a major shift in the competitive dynamics of the European crypto sector. As smaller firms struggle to shoulder the costs of compliance, their strategic value to larger, more resourceful players will only grow. For acquirers, MiCA-compliant firms represent a safer bet, offering established infrastructure, robust internal controls and governance systems already aligned with regulatory demands. With MiCA emphasizing operational soundness and investor protection, these companies will become prime targets, reducing risks and accelerating post-acquisition integration. In this new era, compliance won\u2019t just be a cost \u2014 it\u2019ll be a mechanism for growth, reshaping the competitive landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/micar-foreign-stablecoins-advantage-in-europe\">MiCAR will give foreign stablecoins a clear advantage in Europe</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The framework itself sets a high bar for transparency and accountability. Under MiCA, any firm planning to invest in or acquire a crypto-asset service provider (CASP) or an asset-referenced token (ART) issuer must notify the national competent authority (NCA) in their EU member state in writing. CASPs, which include companies offering services like trading, custody or asset transfers, will now face detailed regulatory reviews to ensure the deal complies with MiCA\u2019s strict standards.<br /><br />The acquiring party must also provide detailed information to the NCA to facilitate an evaluation of the proposed acquisition or any expansion of an existing qualifying stake. Regulatory due diligence will play a critical role in these transactions under MiCA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/european-union-guidelines-clarify-mica\">European securities regulator seeks limits on non-EU crypto firms</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key factors for approval include the reputation and leadership track record of the acquiring party, the ongoing compliance of the target ART issuer or CASP with MiCA regulations, and the financial stability of the acquirer. These elements will be closely scrutinized to ensure that both parties meet MiCA\u2019s stringent standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While NCAs have other measures that will factor in, it\u2019s clear that MiCA compliance is critical for M&amp;A success. Firms that have clearly established controls in place will be the winners, independent of which aisle of the deal they sit on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firms that fail to comply with MiCA, however, will face serious challenges in the M&amp;A market as their regulatory gaps make them riskier and less appealing to buyers. Non-compliance can lead to fines, expensive fixes or devaluation during due diligence. For non-EU firms, acquiring a MiCA-compliant company to attempt to benefit from the \u201cgrandfathering period,\u201d might seem like an easy way to enter the European market, but this comes with strict ESMA oversight. Regulators will be focused on ensuring investor protection and proper integration of EU-regulated functions, meaning non-EU firms must avoid tactics like regulatory loopholes or improper solicitation that could raise red flags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MiCA-compliant firms will remain attractive targets for non-EU companies seeking easier entry into the European market. Without a MiCA license, non-EU firms risk being excluded from the EU entirely, as the reverse solicitation principle \u201cshould be understood as very narrowly framed and as such must be regarded as the exception; and it cannot be assumed, nor exploited to circumvent MiCA.\u201d To succeed, non-EU acquirers must fully integrate and comply with MiCA\u2019s requirements to meet EU regulatory standards and operate smoothly within the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/stablecoin-regulation-necessary-now-us\">The time for US stablecoin regulation is now&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As regulatory scrutiny intensifies, MiCA\u2019s strict approval process \u2014 focused on reputation, financial stability and compliance \u2014 will ensure that only the most prepared companies thrive in post-acquisition integrations. Firms that fully embrace MiCA\u2019s framework will be best positioned to lead, setting new standards for trust, innovation and sustainable growth in Europe\u2019s evolving crypto ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Bakkt sustained its rally into Tuesday (trading 7% higher midway through the session), while DJT lost more than 8%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social media company began trading on the Nasdaq last spring after a merger with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently hovering around $30, DTJ shares are up almost 150% from their September low, but are still trading about 40% off of their IPO price of $50.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump Media\u2019s recent gains have not been linear, though. Shares rose 65% at the end of October, a rally attributed to increased optimism at the time that Trump <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/prediction-markets-election-odds\">would win</a> the election. The share price since Trump\u2019s victory however has been flat, posting a modest increase the day after the election before erasing gains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, presumably, confused about what a Trump win means for the social media company. Yesterday\u2019s rise shows that investors are decently certain that acquiring Bakkt would be a good move. But the subsequent retreat shows shareholders aren\u2019t exactly sure <em>why</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll be following the acquisition story and will be writing a lot more about what it means when the majority shareholder of a public company moves into the White House.

But that month, the SEC said it <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-delays-bitcoin-etf-options-proposals\">needed more time</a> to consider the proposals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The SEC, on Sept. 20, gave \u201caccelerated\u201d approval of options on BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). About a month later, the SEC <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-approves-cboe-nyse-options-btc-etfs\">greenlit the bids</a> by NYSE and CBOE to list options on other bitcoin ETFs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The CFTC last week essentially yielded to the SEC and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), <a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9008-24\">saying</a> that the listing of these bitcoin ETF options \u201cdoes not implicate the CFTC\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The OCC said in a Monday <a href=\"https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemo/search?utm_source=forward-guidance.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=last-week-today&amp;_bhlid=cc18d512040548fa9bc7f854de1b4deae9cd23de\">memo</a> that it was \u201cpreparing for the clearance, settlement and risk management\u201d of bitcoin ETF options.

Options on IBIT are available today; that fund has grown to have roughly $43 billion in assets under management \u2014 making it by far the largest bitcoin ETF and even bigger than the iShares Gold Trust (IAU).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A few hundred million so far in options volume on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBIT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$IBIT</a> (a ton for Day One).. here's a rank of the contracts by volume, it's almost all calls.

Maybe 50/35/15 [percent], something like that,\u201d Peters said. \u201c[But] I think if you\u2019re right on that trade, you\u2019re gonna, at least for a period of time, wish you\u2019d had a million bucks in solana.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question was really posed within the immediate context. Still, we can backtest Peters\u2019 suggestion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even better, plot it alongside Coinbase\u2019s new benchmark crypto index <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/indexes/digital-assets/coinbase-50\">COIN50</a>, which is currently weighted 51.5% BTC, 23.4% ETH, 7% SOL with the remaining 18% or so spread across 47 other altcoins including DOGE, XRP, BCH and BONK.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXegmmGnRDQiqk9TJjDWKlvEQz_RUF3P9SXxyKmGrmcf6KXsFgs-TCEcpEMh80fQFw5AIu-85VNS40byP8klSJ5ZdIMi6dUes0TDQZvt3wXiwXalps30Ub9t9m-pNvbEJ7WfcXiz?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above, in log view, plots the value of that $1 million allocation from the end of 2020, which is when COIN50\u2019s performance data starts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s indeed an element of time bias. The period starts in the leadup to the epic 2021 bull run when SOL\u2019s market cap was under $100 million (now $117 billion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, back then, it would be questionable just how likely it would be to split a million-dollar allocation between BTC, ETH, and a token so small in relative terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any case, the purple shows the split highlighted by Peters, which turned $1 million into $27 million and would now be at all-time highs for dollar value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ETH maxis were second best with $4.2 million. And while there are currently no ETPs tracking COIN50, if there were, that vehicle would\u2019ve converted to a $3.8 million portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone who aped a million dollars in BTC meanwhile would be holding $3.15 million right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For scale: Anyone who bought an index fund tracking any major benchmark from legacy finance would, at best, be sitting on $1.64 million, via the Nasdaq 100.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a minimum $1.5 million difference between stocks and crypto. It\u2019s hard to put an exact value on risk appetite, but that\u2019s as solid a number as any.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

One such project that\u2019s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren\u2019t useful if they aren\u2019t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation\u2019s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren\u2019t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example \u2014 the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren\u2019t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins \u201cget there.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform\u2019s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan\u2019s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem\u2019s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana\u2019s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Firstly, AI agent sentiment is at an <a href=\"https://x.com/_kaitoai/status/1858812982240682129\">all-time high</a>, as captured by Kaito.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we\u2019ve witnessed AI agents in the last few months integrated into <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/0xresearch-newsletter-goatse-memecoin\">memecoins</a> (GOAT), social media influencers (<a href=\"https://x.com/luna_virtuals\">Luna</a>), venture funds (<a href=\"https://x.com/internetphysics/status/1857419356910813582\">ai16z</a>), launchpads (<a href=\"https://x.com/virtuals_io\">Virtual</a>) and trading (<a href=\"https://x.com/Spectral_Labs\">Spectral</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, ETHGlobal hosted its largest hackathon post-Devcon (about 713 projects submitted), and the use of AI agents absolutely dominated the competition. I don\u2019t know exactly how many teams used AI agents, but <a href=\"https://x.com/stonecoldpat0/status/1858051936446197903\">at</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/wbnns/status/1858018625677840524\">least</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/Jnix2007/status/1858148480465936740\">four</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/benlakoff/status/1858062211522134525\">judges</a> pointed out its prevalence at the hackathon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should know, since I was part of a team that created Dongle Party, an app that leverages AI agents for token trading competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a suite of 1inch APIs under the hood, the application essentially abstracted away the need to navigate between wallets and dapps. Just query your AI agent to look at your wallet balance, send tokens or execute trades, all within the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc57KH9AfcimXYqP4BjWesXQG3ULwbzH5KFsHF4424WtD5nTLeq3UOAgvStundbGf_pdkZyMeY4J60psax-DWiXJtELxSnX_Cf5vhvJPaVMNxVWyRufWPIo2OvEBUhh36Ee3vT7UQ?key=ABNeh2MGSHsSTQy-jt2chRtH\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://dongle-party.vercel.app\">Dongle Party app</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A far more impressive team making use of AI agents was <a href=\"https://x.com/sohey_eth/status/1858046972868936143\">Industry AI</a>, a top 10 finalist that created a gamified interface for multiple agents to work together to complete tasks. Industry AI was bloody impressive for a project completed in a few days, and its capabilities spanned the entire onchain experience, from wallet creation and launching an NFT collection to trading tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc4h5geAKszxomQJr-hpFdWqkpvoyw0yhnq8N8HJliqSzbs9y66cAsS1GDlT7FQHt8ctBo1k2SRqM9cXTSQOUujrwBv1wO52VcxiM6gVS6ET3naMQFtXpta_KcJqp5H9LbbIXX8dA?key=ABNeh2MGSHsSTQy-jt2chRtH\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/industry-ai-4w3vy\">EthGlobal</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there was also <a href=\"https://ethglobal.com/showcase/daogenie-nha62\">DAOGenie</a>, another top 10 finalist that sought to streamline the thick bureaucracy of DAO governance with AI agents. AI applied to DAO governance isn\u2019t a new idea, and it\u2019s something that major DAOs like Maker have been <a href=\"https://forum.sky.money/t/the-5-phases-of-endgame/20830\">experimenting</a> with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute ease in which AI agents can be integrated to serve crypto use cases is largely thanks to Coinbase Developer Platform\u2019s (CDP) <a href=\"https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/agentkit/docs/welcome\">AgentKit SDK</a> running LLMs under the hood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such tools are making the intersection of AI and crypto simpler. If developers can do it in a multiday hackathon, brace yourself for what organized and well-funded teams are going to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesse Pollak, founder of Base, told me confidently at Devcon: \u201cBase is right now at the center of the onchain AI economy. One big focus for us in the next couple months is the use of AI agents for messaging on the XMTP protocol within Coinbase Wallet. We see messaging as a key channel for AI agents to become useful points of reference.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that stuck out to me at the ETHGlobal hackathon was the natural blend of AI agents with the permissionless ethic of crypto building blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In crypto sits an openly accessible stack of world-class tools that are processing billions of dollars in value daily. These battle-tested financial building blocks \u2014 DEXs, L1/L2s, bridges \u2014 are going out of their way to incentivize crypto devs to integrate AI agents to capture value for themselves, in ways that centralized exchanges and banks cannot or will not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that Robinhood or Wells Fargo aren\u2019t looking at AI agents, but that innovation will inevitably be slow and introduced in piecemeal ways within the permissioned confines of TradFi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In both cases, it\u2019s the simple profit motive at work.

Turns out, the firm is averaging \u201ca little bit over $10 billion a day across our futures suite.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust comparing November this year to last, our volume and contract terms are up more than 5x \u2026 and then we\u2019re also seeing increases or records in terms of open interest, where November is also the record month, averaging more than 166,000 contracts. And that\u2019s up 60% compared to October, and up over 3x compared to November 2023,\u201d Vicioso said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The large bitcoin contracts offered by CME are becoming so big that investors \u2014 primarily retail \u2014 are turning to CME\u2019s micro bitcoin contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcRv7msYK1At1aAnjROZlZGEiPE29QRCTDPLp2ZAh-YW8Axeg_UVAs6upccd0sCRUB8KlDOSsafq_3m5bI78j0bOgvCMsWN_fw4wSHXg3uBKYsB5SjcJhz5RaBpZLItAzApU4bsqg?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>A look at the volume CME\u2019s seen since the election</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing an increase in volume in terms of our micro contracts, where those contracts, over the last couple weeks, have been averaging more than a billion dollars a day. When we look at the year, our micro bitcoin contract was averaging between $200 to $300 million per day, and we\u2019re also seeing an uptick in terms of the representation of that smaller contract to the larger contract, whereas for the year, micro bitcoin futures volume represented roughly 6% of bitcoin volumes,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOver the past few trading sessions, we\u2019ve seen a micro contract represent now north of 15% or so of the large bitcoin contracts. We\u2019ve really seen increases across the board.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The makeup of participants is mixed, Vicioso noted. Micro contracts are seeing a fairly even spread of retail and institutional buyers given that the margin is a more \u201cmanageable\u201d number. The readthrough for institutions, in that case, is that they could be testing out fresh strategies and finetuning their exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeyKqSkTfYEiDoHwWW98_nThb-ObQmiaLFiLHB43HCfK6R3yAyugsM8bYI6uk_UDs1T0swKRWA9P4e1xP5GQxRee9lCInAC5e9NvM6tl-lYR942jYPHi_-129VX-Rz0ULDqViQs3A?key=QNtgq33Y3LRZMbcEKF6F1kmT\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: CME</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all of this interest, there is a pickup in volatility across both ether and bitcoin. Vicioso said it\u2019s \u201cpar for the course\u201d and isn\u2019t terribly worried. But he noted that the momentum we\u2019ve seen from bitcoin has carried through a lot of this year and it looks to be a continuing trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Large Open Interest Holders \u2014 which means any entity holding over 25 contracts \u2014 is soaring. As of last Friday, CME recorded a record of around 600 large open interest holders in their futures contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo both our standard BTC and ETH contracts, as well as our micro BTC and ETH contracts, all achieved records in terms of the number of large open interest holders holding those contracts,\u201d Vicioso said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 19, 2024 at 2:36 pm ET: Corrected Open Interest to Large Open Interest Holders.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>The longtime Ethereum DeFi giant Sky has deployed its USDS stablecoin on Solana, the protocol told Blockworks exclusively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDS, which was formerly known as DAI, is the third largest stablecoin by market capitalization, trailing just USDT and USDC. The token had been exclusive to Ethereum since launching in 2017 leading up to today\u2019s deployment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sky was formerly known as Maker prior to its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/maker-rebrands-as-sky-dai-will-be-changed-to-usds\">late-August rebrand</a>. It\u2019s all part of the years-long \u201cendgame\u201d process being carried out by Sky co-founder Rune Christensen. The endgame comes with a slew of changes to one of the oldest DeFi protocols.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christensen has made clear his admiration of Solana, floating the idea of using a <a href=\"http://freestreams-live1.im/new-york-mets-live-stream/\">fork</a> of Solana\u2019s code to build a new chain in 2023. USDS will be made multichain with the help of Wormhole\u2019s native token transfer framework.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/multichain-native-token-transfers\">Wormhole goes multichain with native token transfers</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>USDS\u2019 growth will be incentivized on Solana through liquidity incentive agreements with the DeFi platforms Jupiter, Orca, Kamino and Drift. Sky said the projects will distribute \u201cover 300,000\u201d USDS weekly in liquidity incentives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, PayPal\u2019s stablecoin took a similar approach when <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/paypal-pyusd-stablecoin-live-on-solana\">recently deploying on Solana</a>, shelling out lucrative liquidity incentives to drive market capitalization, particularly on the DeFi platform Kamino. A lot of this liquidity didn\u2019t stick around once the incentives dried up, as Solana\u2019s PYUSD market share has fallen precipitously since August.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But perhaps <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/solana\">Solana</a> and Sky meet each other in a position of mutual need. Sky\u2019s rebrand has been bumpy, and community backlash caused the protocol to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/maker-considers-rebranding-further\">hold a vote</a> about whether to rebrand a second time (Sky won convincingly in a vote <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/325096/just-four-entities-account-for-nearly-all-the-votes-to-keep-makerdaos-rebranding-to-sky\">dominated</a> by four whales). And despite the run-up in nearly every Solana metric, Solana\u2019s stablecoin market share has yet to meaningfully increase. The chain <a href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins/chains\">holds</a> just 2% of all stablecoins compared to 51% for Ethereum, per DeFiLlama.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Sky, deploying on the moment\u2019s buzziest blockchain could give its community something to rally behind. And for Solana, gaining access to the third-largest stablecoin could help grow its slice of the pie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Updated Nov. 19, 2024 at 12:12 pm ET: A prior version of this article stated DAI was launched in 2014.

Crypto assets \u2014 mostly insulated from the selloff \u2014 were largely maintaining their post-election rally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with what caused last week\u2019s dip in equities. In my view, it was a bit of a perfect storm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GOP sweep, as expected, sent share prices higher. When Trump won in 2016, the S&amp;P 500 gained about 6% between election night and Inauguration Day, a slightly bigger bump than the index saw when George W. Bush won in 2000 (+4%).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The market is, apparently, once again betting on <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-trump-potential-tariff-policies\">Trump\u2019s plans</a> (lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations, etc.) as being <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-lenient-crypto-regulation\">good for business</a>. Or, at least the market felt this way until last Thursday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s face it: Trump\u2019s cabinet picks thus far have been controversial. The process, in just two weeks, has been chaotic and dramatic \u2014 likely reminding investors that while a red sweep is typically advantageous for shareholders, a Trump presidency is still, well, a Trump presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These past couple weeks have not exactly been reassuring for those hoping for smooth-sailing politics over the next four years. Couple that with increasing concerns over the economic impacts of Trump\u2019s planned tariffs and mass deportations and it\u2019s no wonder markets pulled back.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter perfect storm condition number two: Inflation is still rising while the job market is proving remarkably resilient. Initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 9 came in at 217,000 vs. the expected 224,000. Core CPI for October showed prices are 3.3% higher than a year ago; that was in line with expectations, but still a far cry from the Fed\u2019s 2% target.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combination makes the Fed\u2019s job more difficult. Chair Jerome Powell told us as much last week when he cautioned the central bank is in no hurry to lower interest rates and will continue to evaluate the data. This week\u2019s data will be telling (but more on that later).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doom and gloom aside, stocks were looking up today. The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite had gained 0.7% as of 2 pm ET. Bitcoin, which seemed to hit a new all-time high almost everyday <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/450b-behemoth-forging-btc-path-to-100k\">last week</a>, was holding steady, hovering around $90,300 Monday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, several big companies report third quarter earnings this week, likely moving markets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the largest publicly listed company by market cap in the world, Nvidia on Wednesday will be the highlight. Investors will be looking for signs that the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/on-the-margin-newsletter-stocks-ai-returns\">recent AI boom</a> is still paying off for the chipmaker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walmart and Target also report this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. As retail powerhouses, their numbers will give us a different look at consumer health.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Vyper developers have also implemented processes for managing vulnerabilities, as highlighted in its <a href=\"https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/security/advisories\">security advisories</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The emphasis on transparency and public reviews aligns with <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>\u2019s broader ethos of decentralization and community trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper\u2019s influence in the Ethereum ecosystem has seen a steady decline over the past few years. Once commanding a notable share of the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, Vyper peaked at 30% in August 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdA2YHmDmRzmRT4v0QwHYX3c15Csm6n73o4Xp1hjHD5G4X_MnJytIBXI6rDv3atfKTfeFFvYq4X5JGcY4qh-RW9EoryL-ugPMOgujLgHRIw0sID8IK5tfm9JySyveQniz5fR7YVaw?key=xOdZlJiqPI0WdTm4JOcOblQn\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>DeFi TVL dominance by smart contract language |<strong> </strong>Source: <a href=\"https://defillama.com/languages\">Defillama</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its share has steadily eroded since, falling to 13.8% by early 2022, 7.6% by the start of 2023, and just 2.2% at the beginning of 2024. As of this month, Vyper accounts for only about 1% of DeFi TVL, illustrating how the language has struggled to maintain momentum against Solidity\u2019s dominance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vyper and Solidity differ significantly in design philosophy and features. In contrast, Solidity\u2019s JavaScript-like syntax is more complex but allows for greater flexibility, catering to developers with experience in traditional programming languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solidity benefits from a mature and extensive ecosystem, with a wide range of tools, libraries and community support, making it the standard for the vast majority of Ethereum projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This expansive tooling and the Web3 developer mind share around Solidity have likely contributed to this shift, although it must be noted Vyper\u2019s decline <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/curve-finance\">mirrors</a> the rise and fall of TVL within Curve itself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its shrinking share, Vyper remains a valuable option for security-focused projects, even as its influence in shaping Ethereum smart contract development has waned over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it is time for a reversal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Egorov, history offers an interesting parallel: In 2005, Python was also a niche language overshadowed by PHP and Java. Over time, Python\u2019s clarity and versatility propelled it to dominate industries like AI and data science. Similarly, Vyper\u2019s focus on security and readability could spark a renaissance as a future-proof language for the next wave of dapps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a ton of Python developers in the world, a fact that <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/algorand-adopts-python\">Algorand is banking on</a> to bring in a fresh class of developers following the adoption earlier this year of Python as its canonical language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ethereum developers, Vyper may now serve a niche audience \u2014 those prioritizing security and simplicity over extensive features. Yet, for projects needing concise and secure smart contracts, it remains a compelling option.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Arca and BlockTower are merging in an all-equity deal, the companies announced last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arca CEO Rayne Steinberg talked to Blockworks about the merger, timing and what this next cycle could look like.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two had been in talks to merge for a little over two months, Steinberg said. They\u2019d always been close, but the merger just \u201cmade so much sense\u201d after talks ramped up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from BlockTower\u2019s venture team, which will be spun out, <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/arca\">Arca</a> and BlockTower plan to retain all their talent under one umbrella. Steinberg will lead the new company, with Jeff Dorman staying on as chief investment officer. Ari Paul, CIO and founder of BlockTower, will be moving to an advisory role, though Steinberg believes he\u2019ll be \u201cvery involved.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steinberg pointed out that the two had to move quickly due to \u201ccrypto years,\u201d which pass much faster than in other sectors. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year, and Steinberg said he couldn\u2019t even imagine what crypto would look like if they waited another whole year to close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/m-a-deals-shifting-tide\">Latest crypto M&amp;A deals signal \u2018the tide is shifting\u2019</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal is for the new entity to become a \u201cone-stop shop for sophisticated investors.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the overall political environment wasn\u2019t a huge factor, it\u2019s definitely going to benefit the new company going forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe see this as a huge white space for the token market,\u201d Steinberg told me. Previously, tokens had been \u201chandicapped\u201d because they haven\u2019t been able to offer elements such as fee switches. If the regulation or enforcement actions around tokens loosen, then Steinberg is confident that he\u2019s bringing the best team to the table.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just about saying that there shouldn\u2019t be regulations or things like that, but sensible regulations that make sense,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/trump-lenient-crypto-regulation\">Traders are banking on Trump\u2019s pro-crypto action</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just tokens that are going to benefit from the new environment. Steinberg said he also remains bullish on activists investing in DAOs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cinefficiencies in the space\u201d have not allowed it to \u201cmature, in having people that drive good governance thinking about outcomes for token holders,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not knocking any regulatory regime or thinking about that. But just when you have an environment where you\u2019ve kind of disallowed any productive use of tokens, from fee switches to utility or things like that\u2026contrary to what you would probably want, you create an environment where only things like memecoins have any real traction, because they literally, by definition, cannot offer anything of a tangible value.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arca doesn\u2019t have any plans for \u201cspecific lobbying,\u201d Steinberg said. But the new company will continue to be a \u201csteward\u201d for the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more clarity, he believes, we\u2019ll see both traditional and activist investors get more involved which, in turn, makes him more bullish. This could also lead to further consolidation down the line as crypto readjusts in the next cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

We also understand which addresses have access to those coins, as well as how long they\u2019ve been held without moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we <em>don\u2019t</em> know is how many coins are lost forever \u2014 BTC tied to private keys that have been destroyed, misplaced or otherwise not passed on after death and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some estimates <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/37171/lost-bitcoin-3-7-million-bitcoin-are-probably-gone-forever\">suggest</a> around 20% of all BTC won\u2019t ever move again, the equivalent of 3.7 million BTC ($318 billion).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll never uncover the private keys for all those coins, but we will always know exactly where they\u2019re sitting onchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same can\u2019t be said for gold and silver. World Gold Council <a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/how-much-gold\">reckons</a> 212,582 tonnes of gold had been mined across all of history as of the end of last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of that, 45% of it has been made into jewelry, 22% in bars and coins, 17% held by central banks and the rest is scattered across the world in various other forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on those figures, the total value of mined gold (analogous to circulating supply) is about $18 trillion. But who knows how much of it is readily available to be brought to market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data for total above-ground supplies for silver is similarly vague. <a href=\"https://8marketcap.com/\">InfinteMarketCap</a>, which tracks all assets against each other, goes by the 2019 CPM Group Silver Yearbook, which says that 1.751 million metric tonnes of silver have been mined to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94526\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-15.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Permanently flipping silver will be a milestone for bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At current prices, that would put silver\u2019s market cap at nearly $1.9 trillion \u2014 almost $200 billion higher than what InfiniteMarketCap shows right now, putting it ahead of bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But again, just how much silver is really out there is an unsolvable mystery. For what it\u2019s worth, a gold <a href=\"https://www.goldpriceforecast.com/explanations/size-the-silver-market/\">blog</a> (probably biased) in 2021 sized silver, within the context of the financial market, at only $108 billion, having removed all silver used for industrial purposes and jewelry from its estimates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would make silver much, much smaller than bitcoin, which is today at $1.8 trillion. But going by the same loose definitions that award gold an $18 trillion value, silver is still bigger than bitcoin \u2014 but only just.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what would it take for bitcoin to flip both silver <em>and</em> gold? The moon math says bitcoin would need to hit $96,000 to eclipse silver \u2014 if it trades flat from here \u2014 and $910,000 to surpass gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it: a single 10x is the goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The firm, which focuses on pre-seed investing, has carved out a niche of being high conviction, Wang said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fund only invests in one project per category, which allows for the fund to lend full support to its investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret formula that\u2019s worked for Portal, Wang said, is a combination of three elements: the \u201cbest\u201d founder and tracking down a thesis that\u2019s only just emerging and the third is the \u201cnetwork to king make.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Fisher, there\u2019s \u201csomething very special about being someone\u2019s first believer\u201d and watching them execute on an idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two launched their first fund in early 2022, which may not have started in rough waters but certainly ended in them as crypto struggled to survive the collapse of FTX and the depegging of Terra\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time around, it was also difficult for Fisher and Wang to raise their fund. They started at the beginning of the year, which was well before bitcoin was carving out new daily all-time highs. Though, clearly, they\u2019re facing a different environment as they look to put the money to work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second fund is bigger than the first \u2014 which was a $40 million fund \u2014 and it speaks to their overall high-risk, high-reward strategy, Fisher said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe try to really generate signal for the industry,\u201d Fisher told Blockworks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other notable news:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Notabene <a href=\"https://x.com/notabene_id/status/1856357556999905676\">said</a> it raised $14.5 million in a Series B round.

The SEC is violating federalism and separation of powers, the attorneys general state.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The language is reminiscent of similar suits we\u2019ve seen in the past. In <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-appeals-sec-rulemaking-petition\">Coinbase\u2019s lawsuit</a> against the SEC, the exchange alleged securities regulators were unlawfully overstepping.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe [SEC] is asserting sweeping new authority over a vibrant, rapidly expanding industry \u2014 digital assets,\u201d Coinbase\u2019s team wrote in the opening brief of the case. \u201cBut the SEC is pursuing this power grab <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sec-2023-crypto-enforcement-actions\">through enforcement actions</a>, and it has refused to set forth its new interpretation of its enabling statutes in a rulemaking, where the lack of legal basis for its self-aggrandizement would be laid bare.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The states\u2019 legal action comes as the industry continues to hold out hope that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term will bring a new era of crypto policy. Trump\u2019s campaign promises to \u201cfire Gary Gensler on day one\u201d and hire Tesla CEO Elon Musk to overhaul \u201cgovernment efficiency\u201d have many crypto fans hopeful the \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d age is coming to an end.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gensler, who has not shared any plans to leave the agency, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424?utm_source=forward-guidance.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=states-serve-sec\">said</a> during a Thursday legal conference in New York that the SEC, under his leadership, has been backed by the law.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCourt after court has agreed with our actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered \u2014 whatever their form,\u201d Gensler said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When closing out his Thursday remarks, though, Gensler made a comment that could be an allusion to his possible departure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a great honor to serve with them, doing the people\u2019s work, and ensuring that our capital markets remain the best in the world,\u201d Gensler said, thanking the staff and his fellow commissioners at the agency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we wrote about last week, SEC chairs tend to resign when the incoming administration differs from the one under which they were appointed. Former Chair (and new US attorney to the SDNY) Jay Clayton announced his resignation on Nov. 16, 2020 after President Joe Biden won.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.

The joke at the time was that a weird <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ai-memecoin-trumps-wlfi-token-sale\">AI chat bot had upstaged</a> Donald Trump\u2019s World Liberty Financial crypto token launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That order of things wouldn\u2019t last long however, as Trump\u2019s presidential election win sent crypto markets surging and overshadowed the resurgent AI-crypto interest. Still, the AI projects spawned and spotlighted during October\u2019s rally have continued apace, even if their star now shines a little less brightly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s still the goat-themed token that started it all, whose chat bot will occasionally post about tokens on X but spends most of its time consumed with edgy posts and uncanny valley AI art. That hasn\u2019t stopped its coin from surging to over $1.1 billion in market capitalization however, leaving the AI bot\u2019s public wallet with almost half a billion-worth in crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth_terminal set off a wave of interest surrounding AI agents who interact with humans to do some kind of blockchain action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Virtuals Protocol is one such project on the Base layer-2. \u201cPump dot fun for AI agents\u201d lets users purchase tokens associated with autonomous AI agents in hopes of the AI bots attracting more investment as they do more interesting things. The most popular Virtuals agent has sprung to $115 million in market capitalization, a 106% increase over the past 24 hours as much of the Ethereum community gathers for Devcon in Thailand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But memecoins are the center of the late AI hype, and Solana is the center of memecoins. One new project in this domain is ai16z, a group that has an AI bot which invests in memecoins based on the recommendations of its members. The project came out of daos.fun, a new crowdfunding mechanism for DAOs on Solana <a href=\"https://x.com/lmrankhan/status/1846257066500923817\">spun</a> up at Alliance DAO. Ai16z\u2019s AI version of Marc Andreessen also <a href=\"https://x.com/pmarca/status/1850312932757770385\">drew</a> a social media shoutout from the real life version of the a16z boss, which is apparently becoming an important component of launching a crypto-AI project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also crypto-AI outfits with grander ambitions. This week, I spoke to Ryan Trattner from DAIN protocol, which is a network for onchain AI apps and bots. Trattner, who was formerly a contractor at the Solana University non-profit, thinks that the future will comprise many AI agents doing different things, so he\u2019s helping build DAIN to house them all. He demonstrated to me how an AI agent on the network can <a href=\"https://x.com/dainprotocol/status/1847780512732950949\">order</a> a Chick-Fil-A sandwich and how a different one could trade bitcoin based on Polymarket\u2019s presidential election odds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trattner said DAIN could let him \u201corder food in the same [interface] where I\u2019m trading my memecoins.\u201d That doesn\u2019t strike me as the most in-demand use for AI, but then again, with bitcoin shooting above $90,000, everything seems to be on the table right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even though the headlines and X feeds seemed to have cooled on AI-crypto integrations for the moment, those AI-crypto startups don\u2019t seem to be losing steam.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The latest keynote on the topic was Martin Koeppelmann of Gnosis, who spoke Friday on the event\u2019s main stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearing a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/tornado-cash\">Tornado Cash</a> t-shirt, Koeppelmann challenged the status quo of layer-2 <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/rollups\">rollups</a>, proposing that Ethereum should instead develop and deploy its own zk-proven rollups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koeppelmann emphasized the limitations of existing rollups such as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/base\">Base</a>, which he argued are bringing users not to Ethereum but to corporate-controlled platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have the highest respect for Jesse [Pollack] and Coinbase,\u201d he remarked, \u201cbut bringing people to those L2 ecosystems is quite different from being on Ethereum.\u201d He warned of the potential for shareholder-driven decisions \u2014 like the introduction of additional fees in the future \u2014 that could undermine the Ethereum ethos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A central critique was the marketing claim that rollups \u201cinherit Ethereum\u2019s security.\u201d While possible in principle, Koeppelmann noted that <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/layer-2-secured-by-ethereum\">none of them does</a> in practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He illustrated vulnerabilities such as central sequencers\u2019 ability to censor withdrawals or manipulate state in DeFi platforms like Aave, <a href=\"https://x.com/koeppelmann/status/1857053973431103955\">as articulated</a> in a Devcon talk by James Prestwhich. Moreover, he noted that most assets on rollups are native to those chains, not subject to Ethereum\u2019s security guarantees.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What would native L2\u2019s look like?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Koeppelmann envisioned 128 identical interoperable native L2s, rigorously built with Ethereum\u2019s high standards \u2014 no multisigs, multiple client implementations, and community scrutiny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number is a bit arbitrary, but \u201cthe idea is to make it clear that building on Ethereum is a long-term viable option,\u201d he explained, with a goal to achieve a \u201c100x increase in effective block space\u201d over the next two years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rollups would maintain strong composability with Ethereum while addressing scalability, cost, and user adoption for billions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key to his proposal is integrating these rollups into Ethereum\u2019s economic framework. For instance, Ethereum validator rewards could incentivize proof correctness, enhancing security and aligning rollups with Ethereum\u2019s values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers would have the option to build directly \u201con Ethereum\u201d rather than on external ecosystems, with the choice of a specific rollup dependent on the dapp\u2019s needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf there are other applications you want to regularly interact with [on a specific rollup], then it would be wise to choose that rollup.\u201d However, for developers requiring only Ethereum mainnet connectivity, \u201cyou should just choose the rollup that is used the least, because that will be the cheapest.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also called for distinct namespaces to prevent address collisions across these L2s, improving cross-chain clarity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Koeppelmann concluded by urging the Ethereum community to act decisively. Without native L2s, he warned, Ethereum\u2019s role could diminish: \u201cThe connection between rollups and Ethereum becomes a meme.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, embracing native rollups could position Ethereum as \u201cthe most important economic zone in the world.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethereum stands at this crossroads, Koeppelmann said, as he challenged the broad community to rethink scalability and governance while staying true to its decentralized ideals.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

There\u2019s no revenue, cashflow or profits pooling with a single source, so no reliable framework for figuring how much each coin is worth. To zero, they said!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The correct answer was: Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to be backed by anything. Bitcoin backs bitcoin. After all, the first coins were sold only for the cost of the energy spent to mine them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, there\u2019s so much more to it. Bitcoin isn\u2019t just powered by its industrialized mining sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s now a whole Crypto-Industrial Complex forging a path for bitcoin and the wider crypto space \u2014 and it\u2019s worth almost half a trillion dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94487\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-14.png\" width=\"944\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The half-trillion behemoth at the heart of crypto</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, the entire crypto market \u2014 as in the actual coins and tokens \u2014 has a $3 trillion-plus capitalization.

Or Solana Labs and Binance, although the latter would\u2019ve almost certainly taken a meaty hit to its valuation after its run-in with the DOJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention the other funds holding billions in crypto altogether that aren\u2019t ETFs, which don\u2019t show up in this data, like Bitwise\u2019s index fund BITW and the ever-expanding roster of Grayscale trusts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94486\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-13.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>The Crypto-Industrial Complex now closely follows the price of bitcoin</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, for many, the Crypto-Industrial Complex as presented here would be the first points of entry into crypto (and, perhaps more critically for this newsletter, their valuations are easily trackable: up 140% year-on-year and 50% above its previous top in 2021).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Michael Saylor, the bitcoin alpha bull provides the orange pull.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tether, the stablecoin with a compelling history, reveals just how deep the rabbit hole goes.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Uniswap, Lido and Aave form the basis for DeFi 101.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>All while the public miners help keep Bitcoin humming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Crypto-Industrial Complex is always churning, gobbling up coins much faster than they can be mined and sold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here we are, just one more ~10% rally away from $100,000.

        "content": "<p>Ethereum circles are endlessly debating whether ETH should be seen as \u201cmoney\u201d in the same way bitcoin is embraced as a commodity currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Devcon talk Thursday, Ethereum Foundation researcher Mike Neuder <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HAh09a5Qec\">laid out</a> his case for ether\u2019s foundational attributes both as a permissionless and programmable asset, and as a resilient form of decentralized money. Neuder explored how <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/price/eth\">ETH</a> can serve as a secure, global currency\u2014 one with intrinsic safeguards for property rights, censorship resistance, and self-sovereignty across the multi-layered Ethereum ecosystem, eventually including its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/rollups\">rollups</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To explain Ethereum\u2019s \u201cpermissionlessness,\u201d Neuder referenced Hayek and Friedman on property rights, emphasizing the unique ownership Ethereum provides to holders of ETH being permissionlessly transferable, storable, and programmable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To distinguish ether from assets whose access can be limited by third parties, Neuder included a critique of centralized stablecoins such USDC and USDT, noting that despite their similar programmability, they lack true property rights. Issuers can, and do <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/tether-freezes-funds-doj\">freeze funds</a>. For Neuder, this capacity marks ETH as a distinct asset within onchain finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pivotal part of Neuder\u2019s presentation highlighted the expanding property rights of ETH across <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/layer-2-2\">layer-2</a> rollups.<br /><br />But there\u2019s a caveat: Rollups haven\u2019t yet reached a <a href=\"https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary\">Stage 2</a> decentralization classification. Once they do, they will allow users to bridge ETH in and out, permissionlessly, maintaining Ethereum\u2019s property rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to force withdrawals ensures that users can always reclaim their assets even if a rollup\u2019s sequencer, or central operator, attempts to censor or disrupt transactions. It\u2019s a core feature of <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/layer-2-secured-by-ethereum\">what it means to be a layer-2</a> network. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/arbitrum\">Arbitrum One</a> and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/optimism\">OP Mainnet</a> have already reached Stage 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neuder detailed Ethereum\u2019s commitment to this mechanism as a way to enhance scaling while protecting users\u2019 autonomy in Ethereum\u2019s rollup-centric strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The talk also addressed Ethereum\u2019s inflation model compared to other cryptocurrencies, situating it alongside <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> as an increasingly \u201csound\u201d currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Ethereum\u2019s transition to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/proof-of-stake\">proof-of-stake</a> in the 2022 <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/ethereum-merge\">Merge</a>, supply growth has significantly slowed, with inflation sitting near 0.9%. This is comparable to Bitcoin\u2019s current 0.8%, which it will maintain until the next <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/history-of-bitcoin-halvings-2\">halving</a> in 2028. Ethereum achieves this balance through a combination of issuance, staking rewards, and an <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/tag/eip-1559\">ETH burn mechanism</a> that fluctuates with network demand, effectively absorbing inflationary pressures during periods of high transaction volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neuder argued that this adaptive model is crucial for long-term security, contrasting with Bitcoin\u2019s fixed supply cap, which <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-network-secure-fees\">may pose challenges</a> for future network security once block rewards vanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to a question about the stability of the ether issuance curve, Neuder acknowledged that adjustments to issuance rates over time \u2014 from changes to the block reward under proof-of-work, to current proposals of tweaking the curve \u2014 have sparked ongoing debate over the importance of maintaining \u201cstrong assurances\u201d regarding ether\u2019s total supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Neuder noted that altering the curve could offer benefits \u2014 such as averting risks associated with high staking rates or the emergence of a dominant liquid staking token (LST) \u2014 he cautioned that frequent changes might undermine confidence in stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This uncertainty could in turn impact \u201ccredible neutrality,\u201d another core value vital for Ethereum\u2019s long-term resilience. Assessing the long-term trade-offs will require careful analysis, ideally involving input from macroeconomists, Neuder said.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94469\" height=\"929\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://x.com/mikeneuder\">Mike Neuder</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One crucial component of Ethereum\u2019s deflationary mechanics is the blob burn effect resulting from layer-2 activity. Ethereum rollups post transaction data to the Ethereum mainnet in \u201cblobs\u201d \u2014 bundles of data stored efficiently to reduce costs. As these blobs are published on the mainnet, they <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-blob-base-fee-surges\">incur fees</a>, a portion of which is burned, contributing to the overall ETH burn. This design enables Ethereum to absorb more L2 transaction activity without overwhelming the base layer, maintaining lower L1 gas fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As L2 usage grows, so does the blob burn effect, intensifying Ethereum\u2019s deflationary pressure during periods of high activity, such as we are seeing this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94468\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-12.png\" width=\"1600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.blockworksresearch.com/analytics/eth\">Blockworks Research</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The total dollar value of ETH burned, over time, spiked dramatically beginning in early November to nearly $15 million. This increase in burned ETH is due to heightened network activity, as transaction fees contribute to the burn rate. As a ratio, the burn ratio reached 182%, resulting in a net reduction of ETH supply in recent days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some within the Ethereum community prefer to de-emphasize the role of ether as \u201csound\u201d money, or even dismiss it outright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin tends to <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html\">discuss</a> Ethereum\u2019s value in terms of its programmability, flexibility, and commitment to decentralization rather than focusing on ETH as a purely monetary asset.There\u2019s a balance to be struck, and Neuder underlined Ethereum\u2019s prime aim, to <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/ethereum-inclusion-lists-scrutiny\">retain</a> credible neutrality and censorship resistance, positioning ETH as a form of digital money grounded in the ethos of self-sovereignty.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

The difficult part of trying to gauge which promises are both realistic and probable now begins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week I sat down with Dr. Stephen Miran, fellow at the Manhattan Institute and senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital. Miran was also at the US Treasury during the first Trump Administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His latest economic paper provides a toolkit of how to unpack and understand a world of increased global tariffs and other protectionist economic policies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Titled <em>\u201cA User\u2019s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System\u201d,</em> the paper is a fascinating roadmap into understanding the ultimate question surrounding a heavyhanded tariff policy: Will it be inflationary or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stephen began our interview discussing the \u201cTriffin world\u201d we live in. Simply put, a Triffin world is the consequence that comes with being the global reserve currency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dollar\u2019s status has for decades resulted in an overvalued currency (when compared to interest rate parity theory) and persistent and rising twin deficits (both a fiscal and a trade deficit).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Triffin world can quickly become a crisis for the reserve currency issuer \u2013 i.e a Triffin\u2019s dilemma, when the total share of global GDP secularly declines \u2014 like it has for the US in recent years:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94459\" height=\"1089\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-11.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of this, deficits widen and further strain the priorities of the reserve currency, creating an imbalance between domestic and international priorities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As proposed by Trump and analyzed by Dr. Miran, one way to \u201crecalibrate\u201d this strain is through either tariffs that rebalance these trade imbalances or an outright currency devaluation that brings the US dollar back in line with interest rate differentials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big question from here is what could the impact of a tariff-heavy policy on domestic inflation be? How much of the price increases gets passed onto consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Dr. Miran analyzes in the paper, the key to this question lies in how much the currency offsets the increase in price:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94458\" height=\"712\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-10.png\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further, one of the key considerations for these tariffs being implemented is the context of the business cycle that we are in, as this will, in part, determine the tariffs\u2019 success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other side of the coin that the paper and interview discuss is outright multilateral and unilateral currency agreements and how they could also help recalibrate the USA from spiraling into a Triffin dilemma.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for understanding the specifics of what style of currency agreement would work best, well you\u2019re just going to have to listen to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65aE9KFMR3Y\">interview</a> to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Sling Money, a global peer-to-peer payments app leveraging stablecoins and Solana, has launched for users with US bank accounts, the startup announced this morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app was conceived as a global equivalent to Venmo that uses the Solana network and Paxos\u2019 USDP stablecoin to move money around instantly for low fees. The move comes as the crypto industry as a whole seems emboldened operating in the US following Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election win last week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sling Money was founded in 2022 by Mike Hudack, who previously was chief product officer at the UK-based neobank Monzo. I spoke with Hudack back in August, and he said he became interested in building a global Venmo with crypto rails after sending crypto from London to a friend in San Francisco while investing in a Montana-based DAO. The KYC protocol and wallet onboarding was onerous, but the payment went through almost instantly, and Hudack realized he\u2019d hit on something useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, Sling Money has deployed in more than 75 countries, which now includes the US. By using stablecoins in tandem with Solana, which charges a fraction of a cent in transaction fees, Sling Money is very efficient, at least if you put aside the question of on- and off-ramping funds. It also plans to make use of RTP and FedNow, which are faster payments networks developed by banks and the Federal Reserve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sling Money has raised $20 million in seed and Series A funding, but its cap table doesn\u2019t have typical crypto names on it: Union Square Ventures led its Series A in August, and Ribbit Capital and Slow Ventures are also investors. USV does a good number of crypto deals \u2014 it notably invested in Coinbase \u2014 but it is more of a generalist tech outfit. The same can be said for Ribbit and Slow. This is all to say that Sling Money isn\u2019t really styled as a crypto app, and it doesn\u2019t feel like one when you use it for peer-to-peer payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a crypto product or a fiat product. It\u2019s a payments product,\u201d Hudack told me in August.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venmo, the PayPal-owned payment platform with tens of millions of accounts in the United States, is the incumbent that Sling Money will have to chase. Like Venmo, Sling charges no transfer fees.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email, Hudack said he plans to pry away Venmo\u2019s market share by starting \u201cwhere Venmo isn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 that is, through international payments. Hudack said the team plans to follow WhatsApp\u2019s growth model by building a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of users for its international offering before convincing them that its product is good for use at home, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hudack added that Sling Money\u2019s bank transfers are faster than Venmo\u2019s, and it sees a potential opportunity to undercut the 1.5-3% that Venmo charges for instant bank withdrawals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben Mills, who is a Solana ecosystem founder who previously headed up product at Venmo, told me on the Lightspeed podcast that despite all its users, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOCmHx8Dids\">Venmo was not profitable</a>. The legacy money transfer system is riddled with expenses that Venmo abstracts away, but Mills compared this to \u201cputting lipstick on a pig.\u201d With cheap and instant transfers facilitated on blockchain rails, Sling Money could ditch some of these expenses altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a society we\u2019ve spent the last ~25 years connecting the world through media,\u201d Hudack said. \u201cYou can stream video from any point on earth to any other point on earth, you can text anyone in the world, you can email, you can have a voice call with anyone on the planet. All for free. We\u2019ve got the technology now to connect the entire world financially and we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

But I think if you look in a year or two years from now, it\u2019ll still be much higher than it is today.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulop, a Democrat,&nbsp;said in July that Jersey City\u2019s pension fund was planning on getting exposure to BTC funds. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Not my normal subject matter in a post but I\u2019ll share anyway \u2013 the question on whether Crypto/Bitcoin is here to stay is largely over + crypto/Bitcoin won.

That was back in May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-exposure-pensions-endowments\">Pensions\u2019 move to BTC is slow, steady</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metro then presented the idea to the pension fund\u2019s board, composed of five commissioners. The board had questions \u2014 such as the time horizon it might hold the BTC products \u2014 but did not show opposition, the Jersey City officials noted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the limited track record for the US spot bitcoin ETFs (they <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/how-we-got-here-bitcoin-etf\">launched in January</a>) compared to other assets with year-over-year track records, the board had to update some of its investment rules.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was done about a month ago, Metro said. And standard protocol, he added, is for the pension fund to abstain from making any significant changes in the month of an election, due to volatility.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow that the asset is identified as part of our investment strategy, we\u2019ll actually go to the physical market in the next three weeks,\u201d Metro told Blockworks Tuesday. He noted the post-election time was not intended, but rather how the timeline played out given the various steps needed before allocating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pension fund \u2014 with about $225 million \u2014 is looking at the BTC products offered by BlackRock and Fidelity, given their high volumes. It could look to establish a 2% or so position in bitcoin ETFs as a start, the officials said \u2014 trimming allocations in other assets to make room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fulop and Metro didn\u2019t detail which assets it would reduce exposure to. However, the mayor did note the similarity between gold and bitcoin when it comes to serving as a \u201cstore of value.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd if you think about the utility relative to gold, in many ways bitcoin is more advantageous in the sense that you can move bitcoin around instantaneously,\u201d Fulop added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep reading for more excerpts from my interview with Fulop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>______________________________________________________________________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blockworks: </strong>When did you first get interested in crypto?<strong><br /></strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Fulop: </strong>I have been a believer in the importance of crypto and blockchain \u2014 both separately \u2014 since 2018, 2019. I\u2019ve been a personal investor for some time in different cryptocurrencies.<br /><br />I believe in the technology, I think it\u2019s important and I think at this point it\u2019s inevitable. The conversation about whether it\u2019s going to exist long term, or not exist, has been put to bed. I think we all recognize it\u2019s here to stay long term and it\u2019s an asset class in and of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blockworks: </strong>What do you make of Donald Trump\u2019s crypto stance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fulop:</strong> His policies and his comments certainly reflect the fact that he\u2019s a supporter. Now, who knows in actuality how he feels about it. But I do think that he\u2019s politically smart in the fact there are tens of millions of crypto wallets out there among Americans \u2014 particularly younger Americans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So capturing that audience, he was very smart to do, and the reality is the people who have those crypto wallets are not only skewing younger but they\u2019re people who certainly believe in the technology, have concerns about fiat money and are looking to be engaged in the political system in a way to make sure that this remains a viable asset class.<br /><br />Do I think he\u2019s going to follow through in promoting or appointing an SEC chairman and individuals that are crypto friendly? Yes. So I think you\u2019re still in the early phases of all this stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blockworks: </strong>Might Jersey City\u2019s pension fund look to allocate to ether ETFs next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fulop: </strong>The pension fund has only looked at bitcoin at this point. I think that we\u2019re in the early phases of getting people comfortable with a pension fund allocating any resources toward crypto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think Ethereum is here to stay and I would feel comfortable, but it\u2019s not all my money in the pension funds. And I think pension fund fiduciaries and the board recognize they need to be cautious with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blockworks: </strong>Are you considering any other crypto-related policies or initiatives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fulop: </strong>We haven\u2019t started thinking about accepting crypto or bitcoin as an official payment for anything with regards to City Hall\u2019s day-to-day operations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the reasons for that is I think there\u2019s a little bit of time before there\u2019s more stability in the price. You\u2019ve seen even over the last week the huge run from $68,000 to $90,000 per coin \u2014 and, like I said, I think you\u2019re in the early phases of that.<br /><br />Is that related to Trump? Is that post-halving? What does it look like in 10 years? There\u2019s a lot of questions that create fluctuation. It\u2019s clearly a volatile space; I think that\u2019s fair to say. And, generally speaking, when city governments get involved in accepting a payment for something, you\u2019re not looking for extreme volatility because we have to run an operation here day to day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This interview was edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p>Blockchain interoperability is mission-critical for the Web3 industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bogged down by fragmented networks, siloed data, and poor user experiences, the industry continues to pour resources into solutions to overcome these barriers and achieve seamless communication across chains.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll review the importance of blockchain interoperability, its current challenges, and the potential solutions offered by <a href=\"https://union.build/\">Union</a>, a leading interoperability protocol that connects chains across ecosystems like Ethereum, Cosmos, Bitcoin L2s, and more through modular, permissionless, and hyper-efficient solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s get started with the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding blockchain interoperability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain interoperability allows different blockchain networks to communicate and exchange data seamlessly. This connectivity drives liquidity across chains, promoting efficient capital flows and expanding market access for dApps. By breaking down technical barriers, interoperability opens new opportunities for DeFi and other sectors, enabling projects to scale across multiple ecosystems without reliance on a single network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without interoperability, blockchains operate in isolation, limiting growth and adoption. Developers often face the challenge of balancing their product vision with the need for access to essential resources like liquidity and users, hindering industry-wide innovation. As blockchain ecosystems and user bases expand, so does the demand for efficient cross-chain interactions. Interoperability\u2019s economic potential is significant: it\u2019s projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/blockchain-interoperability-market\">a global market valuation of $3 billion by 2034</a>, rising at a CAGR of 27.5% across the decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The economic advantages are particularly evident in unlocking liquidity and accessing broader user bases, enabling capital and assets to flow freely between chains. This connection of previously siloed ecosystems stands to greatly increase the overall efficiency of DeFi and other Web3 sectors, benefiting both developers and end-users alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The interoperability models you should know</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Two primary models of blockchain interoperability exist: centralized and decentralized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In centralized interoperability models, a single entity manages communication between blockchains. While this centralization can lead to greater efficiency, it also introduces vulnerabilities by relying on a single point of control, making the system more susceptible to failures or attacks. In contrast, decentralized networks enhance resilience and security by distributing control across multiple validators or nodes, reducing the likelihood of a single point of failure. This distributed approach can, however, lead to slower decision-making and reduced efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union takes a different path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of trying to balance tradeoffs, Union\u2019s decentralized interoperability framework supersedes the status quo by embracing trust-minimized principles in its modular architecture, allowing for secure and efficient cross-chain communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Progression toward consensus verification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With new chains continuously launching, blockchain ecosystems are becoming increasingly fragmented. As users, applications, and liquidity spread across multiple L1 and L2 layers, secure interoperability becomes essential. This fragmentation, however, can disrupt composability, making cross-chain interactions less efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consensus mechanisms, such as <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/proof-of-stake-investors-guide\">Proof of Stake (PoS)</a>, are essential for validating and securing transactions within individual blockchains. However, for cross-chain interoperability, consensus verification\u2014where one blockchain verifies that consensus was reached on another\u2014is the gold standard to ensure secure communication between chains. However, consensus verification can be resource-intensive, making it cost-prohibitive to implement in certain ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address these challenges, <a href=\"https://union.build/blog/consensus-verification\">Union integrates Zero-Knowledge (ZK) circuits</a> to reduce the computational complexity of consensus verification.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A high-efficiency approach to cross-chain security</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Union builds on the <a href=\"https://tutorials.cosmos.network/academy/3-ibc/1-what-is-ibc.html\">Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)</a> by embedding consensus verification within ZK circuits. By verifying consensus without needing to validate every validator\u2019s signature on the counterparty chain, Union\u2019s ZK circuits enable faster, more cost-effective cross-chain interactions. This setup allows one blockchain\u2019s state to be verified within another\u2019s environment without external trust assumptions, minimizing computational overhead while boosting speed and cost-effectiveness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, Union\u2019s approach supports global interoperability by <a href=\"https://docs.union.build/architecture/cometbls/\">aggregating Boneh\u2013Lynn\u2013Shacham (BLS) signatures within its ZK circuit</a>, which combines multiple validator signatures into a single proof. This boosts security and transaction efficiency while reducing computational costs and latency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through its network of ZK Proofs (ZKPs), Union provides a highly efficient cross-chain communication system, validating each chain\u2019s state in real-time and unlocking seamless cross-chain composability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Modular interoperability: building flexible and scalable solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Modular interoperability refers to the ability to selectively implement interoperability as part of a broader modular architecture. Union offers SDKs that empower developers to integrate multi-chain interoperability without significant overhead, promoting flexibility while ensuring applications can grow smoothly across multiple blockchain ecosystems. This design reduces barriers to entry, supports long-term scalability, and allows developers to adapt their solutions based on specific needs, enabling gradual adoption as demand grows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Union\u2019s role in the future of interoperability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Union plays a pivotal role in lowering barriers to entry for developers by simplifying blockchain interoperability. Without advanced solutions, developers face high costs and technical complexity when integrating cross-chain functionality. Union\u2019s SDKs help alleviate these challenges by reducing the effort and expense associated with cross-chain communication, making advanced interoperability accessible to a wider range of projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union differentiates itself by prioritizing scalability, speed, and trustless security, while seamlessly integrating with multiple execution environments like EVM, SVM, and altVMs (supporting languages like Solidity, Rust, and Move). In a sector often reliant on centralized solutions, Union\u2019s decentralized framework drives widespread adoption and innovation. This flexible, efficient architecture reduces computational load, improves scalability, and enables faster, more secure, and cost-effective interactions, making Union adaptable to diverse blockchain ecosystems and an ideal solution for developers aiming to minimize integration costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Union\u2019s increasing arsenal of capabilities are highlighted by the following recent innovations:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Intents Bridging</strong><br />Union\u2019s <a href=\"https://research.union.build/Intents-Bridging-10c79e5af45d80a3a0f8dde7159138af\">intents bridging</a> allows third parties, or solvers, to instantly fulfill cross-chain transactions, significantly reducing finality lag. By stepping in to complete transfers before they are finalized, solvers unlock near-instantaneous cross-chain experiences for users while assuming the associated risks. This model not only improves transaction speed but also creates new opportunities for developers to build more efficient and flexible applications by leveraging intent-based mechanisms, further enhancing the liquidity and responsiveness of decentralized networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>State Lenses</strong><br /><a href=\"https://research.union.build/State-Lenses-9e3d6578ec0e48fca8e502a0d28f485c\">State lenses</a> facilitate direct chain-to-chain connections, allowing transfers to bypass intermediate settlement layers, e.g., transfers can now move directly from Chain A to Chain C, without needing to re-execute the transfer on Chain B. This streamlined approach reduces both latency and computational costs, which enhances Union\u2019s efficiency and scalability, and makes it well-suited for decentralized financial systems and other cross-chain applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unifying Settlement</strong><br />Union acts as a highly efficient <a href=\"https://research.union.build/Unifying-Settlement-11c79e5af45d80d48a60cb9cfbce1f17\">settlement layer</a> by leveraging light client updates similar to rollup settlement functions. With minimal data stored, light clients can verify transaction validity and maintain the state root. Union\u2019s architecture extends to both ZK and optimistic rollups, enhancing cross-chain settlement speed and flexibility. By incorporating proofs of execution and supporting multiple Data Availability (DA) layers, Union enables fast finality and seamless settlement across ecosystems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Empowering the future of blockchain interoperability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain interoperability is critical for the future of decentralized systems, enabling seamless communication and data transfer between different blockchains. Union plays a pivotal role in driving this evolution by providing modular, permissionless, and highly efficient tools. Through its innovations in consensus verification, ZK Proofs, and decentralized architecture, Union empowers developers to build faster, more secure, and scalable applications across multiple chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the protocol and get involved in its journey, builders can browse their <a href=\"https://docs.union.build/\">comprehensive documentation</a>.

That suit is ongoing. Both tokens were also called out in the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/forward-guidance-newsletter-wells-notice\">Wells notice</a> the securities regulator sent to Crypto.com last month.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robinhood\u2019s move comes as the crypto industry continues to ride a wave of euphoria and higher prices in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s win last week. His promises to overhaul SEC leadership and make the US a hub for digital asset businesses have many feeling optimistic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let\u2019s consider a scenario. Even if Trump replaces Gary Gensler with another current commissioner, most legal experts agree that Trump can\u2019t actually remove Gensler entirely. So he\u2019d still be a commissioner even if, say, Mark Uyeda becomes acting chair in January.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To drop a lawsuit (such as the one against Coinbase), SEC staff would have to propose it to the commissioners, who would then vote.

Jito\u2019s standstill came one day after it processed a record 15 million bundles in one day, shattering its previous high of 13.9 million.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roughly 90% of Solana validators responsible for running the blockchain make use of Jito\u2019s software, so one immediate concern was whether the Solana network itself would experience an outage. However, bundles are just one piece of the Jito-Solana client. Transactions continued to be processed throughout the outage, Jito co-founder Lucas Bruder <a href=\"https://x.com/buffalu__/status/1856722608697250112\">told</a> me on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During what has now been a month of consecutive record-breaking demand for access to the Solana blockchain, Jito and <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-wallets-grass-airdrop\">other key pieces of Solana infrastructure</a> have strained to process the load.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the all-time high in bundles, Jito MEV tips, which are extra fees paid by traders hoping to get their transaction prioritized, are currently roughly double what they were even during the memecoin craze of this summer. Yesterday, users paid some $6.2 million in extra MEV tips to validators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jito validators started complaining of performance issues at around 4:00 Wednesday morning, but the outage was declared at 9:30 am, and bundles started working again by 11 am. Solana DeFi protocols Jupiter and Save both had features break during the Jito outage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jito made a Telegram <a href=\"https://t.me/+Kg-WnMfiQJAwZjQx\">channel</a> in late October to update customers on its block engine, the piece of software that reorders transactions to order Jito blocks as lucratively as possible. The chat shows Jito has had two other system issues since Saturday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some Solana watchers, the incident was an interesting experiment in what the blockchain\u2019s fee markets would do without Jito\u2019s infrastructure. Blockworks Research analyst Dan Smith posted a <a href=\"https://x.com/smyyguy/status/1856736831917732258\">chart</a> showing that during Jito\u2019s outage, the blockchain\u2019s median priority fee briefly jumped. That means that while Jito was down, it essentially became more expensive to land transactions on the blockchain. The median fee went back down when Jito started working again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPretty cool \u2026 the theory actually works in practice,\u201d Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko wrote in response. Jito is a bit slower and more reliable than run of the mill transaction fees, Yakovenko added. Some transaction senders pay a premium for this reliability, and this serves to \u201cactually lower the median fees for everyone else,\u201d Yakovenko said.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Yet, Ethereum\u2019s rapid scaling has led to fragmentation, sparking concerns about interoperability and user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buterin lamented the current need for custom solutions whenever users operate across multiple chains. He likened the ideal Ethereum experience to credit card use in Web2, where everything seamlessly connects behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf Ethereum cannot meet that level of experience,\u201d Buterin warned, \u201cit\u2019s going to lose to things that do.\u201d Still, he praised the commitment of L2 and wallet developers tackling these challenges head on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The panel discussed a crucial concern: the competition for users and developers among Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum, each vying for liquidity and mind share. Stephen Goldfeder voiced a shared sentiment: Users shouldn\u2019t be burdened with infrastructure complexities. He advocated for a \u201cunified Ethereum,\u201d envisioning seamless transitions across chains within the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones and Pollak each echoed the need for interoperability without restrictive silos, referencing Ethereum\u2019s Superchain vision to support user-friendly, cross-chain interactions, suggesting the competition between the major \u201cconstellations\u201d of L2 networks is a bit of an illusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key challenge lies in bridging technical and experiential gaps. While Jones argued that EVM-equivalence should theoretically simplify deployment, current reality presents high overhead for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitalik stressed the need for easier asset movement across chains and agreed with Pollak that interfaces which \u201chide addresses,\u201d that often confuse users in favor of names, would help. Pollak\u2019s focus on simplicity in wallets and interfaces, underscored Base\u2019s focus on building \u201copen source on open standards,\u201d aimed at empowering users even if centralized entities \u2014 like Coinbase \u2014 were to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the concrete steps the panel explored was the need for on-chain configurations for L2 networks. Parameters such as chain IDs and other identifiers, are foundational for distinguishing each L2 within the Ethereum ecosystem. By establishing standard data points across these networks, wallets, dapps and users can easily recognize and interact with various L2s without needing custom configurations for each one. Expanding these standards could enable deeper interoperability and more seamless interactions between L2s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One significant benefit of standard on-chain configs is the potential for a universal light client \u2014 a tool that verifies and interacts with multiple L2s without requiring chain-specific adaptations. That way a single light client could authenticate transactions and verify data across all participating L2s. This reduces technical friction, creating a more integrated network where assets, data, and applications flow easily across chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardized protocols like <a href=\"https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rip-7755-contract-standard-for-cross-l2-calls-facilitation/20776/4\">RIP-7755</a> and ERC standards that don\u2019t require protocol changes could facilitate cross-chain operations, including advanced proof structures, Pollak said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jones and Buterin emphasized the long-term goal of bringing rollups to <a href=\"https://medium.com/l2beat/introducing-stages-a-framework-to-evaluate-rollups-maturity-d290bb22befe\">Stage 1 or 2</a>, to mitigate inherent governance risks. Fast, secure bridging was recognized as an urgent need, especially with a push for wallet innovations that incorporate chain abstraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the panel articulated a shared mission: enhancing user experience without compromising Ethereum\u2019s decentralized ethos, aiming for an ecosystem where users, not chains, remain at the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

This time last week, on Nov. 6, CME notched its highest notional volume day with over $16.4 billion transacted in over 316,000 contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs Trump\u2019s win became clear, futures premiums began to soar and have since risen above 15% as BTC continued its rally towards $90,000. Despite aggressive positioning, we note that market tops rarely coincide with CME premiums in an uptrend, a promising indicator for now,\u201d K33 analysts wrote. Open interest on CME grew by $2.4 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-94397\" height=\"518\" src=\"https://blockworks-co.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-8.png\" width=\"878\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: K33</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>$100,000 is clearly on the table, and it might even be a reality before the end of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhile the market is due for a breather, we expect prices to head in this direction in the coming weeks. Round numbers tend to be extreme volatility triggers, exemplified by BTC\u2019s $10k breakout in 2017,\u201d analysts Vetle Lunde and David Zimmerman continued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe first $10k visit happened on November 29, 2017, a day seeing intraday highs of $11,465 and intraday lows of $8,579, a high-low spread of a massive 34%. A whipsaw of softer magnitude (19%) happened on November 30 before a firm breakout was established on December 1. An eventual $100,000 breakout is well-shaped up to face mirroring volatility.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Galaxy\u2019s Alex Thorn noted that Monday\u2019s price action in bitcoin notched the \u201c49th biggest gain in history,\u201d though he was careful to highlight that there was a lot of dramatic price action in the early days of bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, we\u2019re obviously not just watching bitcoin, so I wanted to take a look at how the rally could impact other parts of crypto.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBTC\u2019s momentum has awoken the animal spirits within perp traders, as funding rates continue to soar above neutral levels for both BTC and altcoins, indicating heavy long positioning,\u201d K33 said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tie the election outcome to lower interest rates and bam! You have a pretty favorable DeFi environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard not to be a bull these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> \u2014 market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

On Nov. 21, a crypto trader named &#8220;r_cky0&#8221; <a href=\"https://x.com/r_cky0/status/1859656430888026524\">reported</a> losing $2,500 in digital assets after seeking ChatGPT&#8217;s help to create a bot for <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/\">Solana</a>-based memecoin generator Pump.fun.</p>\n<p>However, the chatbot recommended a fraudulent Solana API website, which led to the theft of the user&#8217;s private keys. The victim noted that within 30 minutes of using the malicious API, all assets were drained to a wallet linked to the scam.</p>\n<p><em>[Editor&#8217;s Note: ChatGPT appears to have recommended the API after running a search using the new SearchGPT as a &#8216;sources&#8217; section can be seen in the screenshot. Therefore, it does not seem to be a case of AI poisoning but a failure of the AI to recognize scam links in search results.]</em></p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 1418px;\"><img alt=\"AI scam link API (Source: X)\" height=\"958\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gc7SoMDWYAAvsS6?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" width=\"1418\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">AI scam link API (Source: X)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Further investigation revealed this address consistently receives stolen tokens, reinforcing suspicions that it belongs to a fraudster.</p>\n<p>The Slowmist founder noted that the fraudulent API&#8217;s domain name was registered two months ago, suggesting the attack was premeditated. Xian furthered that the website lacked detailed content, consisting only of documents and code repositories.</p>\n<p><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">While the poisoning appears deliberate, no evidence suggests\u00a0<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/openai/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> intentionally integrated the malicious data into ChatGPT&#8217;s training, with the result likely coming from SearchGPT.</span></p>\n<h2>Implications</h2>\n<p>Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer <a href=\"https://x.com/realScamSniffer/status/1859765453536756130\">noted</a> that this incident illustrates how scammers pollute AI training data with harmful crypto code. The firm said that a GitHub user, &#8220;solanaapisdev,&#8221; has recently created multiple repositories to manipulate AI models to generate fraudulent outputs in recent months.</p>\n<p>AI tools like <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/chatgpt-drives-openai-toward-1b-revenue-goal-after-losing-540m-in-2022/\">ChatGPT</a>, now used by hundreds of millions, face increasing challenges as attackers find new ways to exploit them.</p>\n<p>Xian cautioned crypto users about the risks tied to large language models (LLMs) like GPT. He emphasized that once a theoretical risk, AI poisoning has now materialized into a real threat. So, without more robust defenses, incidents like this could undermine trust in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coinbase-launches-new-tool-to-help-users-build-ai-agents-in-minutes/\">AI-driven tools</a> and expose users to further financial losses.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/blockchain-security-firm-warns-of-ai-code-poisoning-risk-after-openais-chatgpt-recommends-scam-api/\">Blockchain security firm warns of AI code poisoning risk after OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT recommends scam API</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

Analyzing their respective performances allows us to gain insight into the global Bitcoin market and how local economic conditions influence price action. While this data is limited to a single exchange, in this case, Bitstamp, it provides a representative view of broader trends and allows for meaningful conclusions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Year-to-date, BTCEUR has delivered the highest returns, with a gain of 130.39%, compared to 122.24% for BTCGBP and 120.85% for BTCUSD. This outperformance can largely be attributed to the euro&#8217;s weakness relative to the dollar and pound. With the Eurozone grappling with low growth and limited monetary policy flexibility, the currency has suffered against a backdrop of dollar strength.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This depreciation amplifies Bitcoin&#8217;s gains in EUR terms, as it takes more euros to purchase the same amount of BTC. By contrast, the dollar&#8217;s strength\u2014underpinned by strong US economic data, robust Treasury yields, and expectations of higher-for-longer Federal Reserve policy\u2014has dampened BTCUSD&#8217;s apparent gains, as a stronger dollar offsets the upward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_454103\" style=\"width: 1226px;\"><img alt=\"bitcoin fiat pairs ytd performance\" class=\"size-full wp-image-454103\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bitcoin-fiat-pairs-ytd-performance.png\" width=\"1226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-454103\">Graph showing the YTD performance of BTCUSD, BTCGBP, and BTCEUR (Source: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/nDPOT2hW/\">TradingView</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the three-month window, the trends remain consistent, with BTCEUR continuing to outperform BTCGBP and BTCUSD. During this period, euro weakness became even more pronounced, falling to a one-year low against the dollar. This decline reflects a combination of disappointing Eurozone growth metrics, dovish signals from the European Central Bank, and geopolitical uncertainties.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Meanwhile, BTCGBP has shown a slightly more robust performance than BTCUSD, highlighting the pound&#8217;s relative weakness. The UK&#8217;s persistent economic stagnation and reduced hawkishness from the Bank of England have placed pressure on GBP, even as it maintains marginally more resilience than the euro.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_454104\" style=\"width: 1226px;\"><img alt=\"bitcoin fiat pairs 3m performance\" class=\"size-full wp-image-454104\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bitcoin-fiat-pairs-3m-performance.png\" width=\"1226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-454104\">Graph showing the three-month performance of BTCUSD, BTCGBP, and BTCEUR (Source: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/nDPOT2hW/\">TradingView</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">The price action since the US election shows that Bitcoin&#8217;s performance against these three currencies reflects the most recent macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. BTCUSD gained 42.38%, trailing BTCEUR and BTCGBP, which grew 46.22% and 45.87%, respectively. The dollar&#8217;s persistent strength has been vital in tempering BTCUSD&#8217;s gains. The market&#8217;s response to the US election was aggressive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As the upcoming Trump administration&#8217;s policies are expected to boost US growth, the election strengthened the dollar and drove further demand for US assets, weighing on BTCUSD. In contrast, BTCEUR and BTCGBP were relatively unaffected by this political event, and their performances remained largely a function of their respective fiat weaknesses.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_454105\" style=\"width: 1226px;\"><img alt=\"bitcoin fiat pairs 1m performance\" class=\"size-full wp-image-454105\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bitcoin-fiat-pairs-1m-performance.png\" width=\"1226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-454105\">Graph showing the one-month performance of BTCUSD, BTCGBP, and BTCEUR (Source: <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/nDPOT2hW/\">TradingView</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">The divergence in Bitcoin&#8217;s performance across these pairs also shows the influence fiat volatility has on perceived returns. The euro and the pound have been far more volatile than the dollar this year, particularly given the contrasting monetary policies and economic prospects of each area.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This volatility exaggerates Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements in EUR and GBP terms, creating the illusion of greater returns compared to BTCUSD. As the Eurozone continues to face structural growth challenges, Bitcoin&#8217;s outperformance against the euro is likely to persist. While under similar pressure, the pound has shown slightly more resilience due to less severe structural concerns, which aligns with BTCGBP&#8217;s middle-ground performance relative to BTCUSD and BTCEUR.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_454106\" style=\"width: 1226px;\"><img alt=\"bitcoin fiat pairs performance since us election\" class=\"size-full wp-image-454106\" height=\"792\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/bitcoin-fiat-pairs-performance-since-us-election.png\" width=\"1226\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-454106\">Graph showing the performance of BTCUSD, BTCGBP, and BTCEUR from Nov. 4 to Nov. 21, 2024 (Source: TradingView)</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">The short-term trends observed since the US election on Nov. 5 reveal a rather interesting market state. Despite the USD&#8217;s strength, BTCUSD steadily increased during this period. This suggests that while the dollar&#8217;s strength muted Bitcoin&#8217;s gains compared to BTCEUR and BTCGBP, it did not entirely stifle its price momentum.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For BTCEUR and BTCGBP, continued EUR and GBP weakness after the election allowed Bitcoin to sustain its relative outperformance. This is particularly relevant given that Eurozone and UK markets increasingly look to Bitcoin as a hedge against depreciating fiat currencies.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/weak-euro-fuels-bitcoins-standout-performance-in-eurozone/\">Weak euro fuels Bitcoin&#8217;s standout performance in Eurozone</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",

The court agreed, describing the SEC&#8217;s definition of &#8220;dealer&#8221; as &#8220;untethered from the text, history, and structure&#8221; of the law.</p>\n<p>Blockchain Association CEO Kristen Smith <a href=\"https://t.co/w2j8GmQf4C\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;This ruling is a victory for the entire digital asset industry.

Today&#8217;s decision curtails that overreach and safeguards the future of our industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The SEC&#8217;s dealer rule, introduced earlier this year, sought to broaden the regulatory scope for market participants dealing in securities. Critics argued the rule would impose onerous compliance burdens on blockchain developers and small businesses, stifling innovation in the rapidly growing sector.</p>\n<p>CFAT, a Texas-based trade group, joined the legal battle, calling the SEC&#8217;s actions a clear case of regulatory overreach.</p>\n<p>Marisa Coppel, head of legal at the Blockchain Association, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cLitigation is never our first choice, but it is sometimes necessary to defend the industry from overzealous regulation. The court&#8217;s decision underscores the importance of adhering to the boundaries of statutory authority.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed in April, marked a significant pushback against what many in the digital asset community see as the SEC&#8217;s aggressive regulatory agenda. Industry leaders have repeatedly criticized the agency&#8217;s approach, accusing it of using enforcement actions and ambiguous rules to curtail innovation.</p>\n<p>The court&#8217;s ruling is expected to have far-reaching implications for digital asset regulation, signaling that judicial scrutiny of the SEC&#8217;s policies may intensify. Advocates hope the decision will prompt lawmakers and regulators to pursue clearer and more balanced policies for the sector.</p>\n<p>The Blockchain Association represents a coalition of crypto companies, investors, and projects advocating for innovation-friendly regulations.

However, industry observers have long speculated that the firm would eventually embrace direct trading to remain competitive.</p>\n<p>Adding to the speculation, Sigel hinted at behind-the-scenes activity, stating that a prominent crypto asset manager recently approached Schwab to pitch a partnership. While details remain unclear, such collaborations could provide Schwab with a quicker and less risky entry into the spot market, leveraging established expertise to navigate operational and regulatory challenges.</p>\n<h2>Broader institutional shift</h2>\n<p>Shwab&#8217;s evolving stance mirrors a broader <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bernstein-predicts-200k-bitcoin-in-infamous-black-book-amid-rising-institutional-demand/\">shift in institutional attitudes</a> toward digital assets. With regulatory clarity potentially on the horizon, major players in traditional finance are increasingly exploring direct crypto exposure.</p>\n<p>The firm&#8217;s strategic pivot could position it as a key player in the next wave of crypto adoption, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy.</p>\n<p>For now, Schwab appears to be laying the groundwork, aiming to meet investor demand while mitigating risks.

It is unclear whether the position will be included in the rumored <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trumps-crypto-advisory-council-to-setup-promised-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-report/\">Crypto Advisory Council</a>.</p>\n<h2>Giancarlo&#8217;s crypto advocacy</h2>\n<p>Giancarlo previously served as CFTC chair from 2017 to 2019 during <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump&#8217;s</a> first term, during which time he oversaw the introduction of bitcoin futures. He currently advises blockchain advocacy groups and leads the Digital Dollar Project, which explores digital currencies&#8217; potential.</p>\n<p>Giancarlo has championed innovation in financial technology but opposes a federal central bank digital currency (CBDC), a stance aligning with Trump&#8217;s campaign platform.</p>\n<p>Sources close to Trump&#8217;s transition team revealed that Giancarlo had <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-dad-giancarlo-dismisses-sec-chair-rumors-critiques-genslers-legacy/\">declined consideration</a> for roles at the SEC or CFTC but expressed openness to the &#8220;crypto czar position.&#8221; The role would involve crafting regulatory frameworks, advancing stablecoin oversight, and supporting US crypto firms.</p>\n<p>Trump has vowed to overhaul crypto regulation, criticizing the Biden administration&#8217;s enforcement-led approach, which many industry leaders argue has driven innovation offshore. As part of his crypto-friendly agenda, Trump proposed creating a presidential advisory council on digital assets, with the czar potentially playing a key leadership role.</p>\n<p>While industry insiders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ripple&#8217;s Brad Garlinghouse have reportedly supported the idea, some Trump advisers remain skeptical of adding new government roles. Critics view the move as inconsistent with Trump&#8217;s pledge to reduce bureaucracy.</p>\n<h2>Industry and administration outlook</h2>\n<p>The crypto industry has largely welcomed the potential appointment. Figures like Cardano founder <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/charles-hoskinson/\">Charles Hoskinson</a> and Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey have advocated for regulatory clarity and praised Giancarlo&#8217;s expertise.</p>\n<p>Other potential candidates for the position include Bailey and Riot Platforms&#8217; Brian Morgenstern, though Giancarlo remains the frontrunner, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration has not officially confirmed plans to establish the position or the advisory council. Giancarlo told reporters that he would be &#8220;honored to be considered.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If implemented, the crypto czar role could mark a significant shift in U.S. digital asset policy, aiming to balance regulatory oversight with industry growth.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trump-eyeing-former-cftc-chair-chris-giancarlo-for-white-house-crypto-czar-role/\">Trump eyeing former CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo for White House &#8216;crypto czar&#8217; role</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",
