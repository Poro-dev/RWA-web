Both chains were born in the previous crypto cycle, and built by teams with backgrounds in Facebook, which developed the Move programming language as part of its <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/facebook-led-crypto-project-diem-to-be-sold-off-for-200m-report\">Libra</a> (later renamed Diem) project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of price action, SUI has outperformed APT by a large margin on a YTD basis after overtaking Aptos in market cap in mid-September.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcjcTtlwYopTYE2yOIskjzWcqBxEx7D7aBC_Cjmo7doI9Mx2sGFD_tmiAX-9CXtrLg8F-nrgo3qB8gu7C0WH7B0kXRSina0C8LbETBYgqgpCbzhDchR_OEmm95Xj0vEt9oFpjg56g?key=iZHG-iO_AQDsFz_3x3YWxSrN\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sui/\">CoinMarketCap</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite <a href=\"https://x.com/SuiNetwork/status/1859705664362381559\">suffering</a> a brief two-hour outage yesterday, SUI’s price has bounced back above its pre-outage price levels, ironically reinforcing the mimetic perception of Sui as the next Solana due to the latter’s <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/solana-downtime-post-mortem\">history of outages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of TVL, Sui and Aptos are running fairly neck to neck (see below chart), no doubt thanks to ongoing <a href=\"https://blockworks-research.beehiiv.com/p/saving-self-custody\">liquidity incentive</a> campaigns. As far as active dapps on the L1s, both are also fairly even — Sui has 44, Aptos has 49 — based on <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chains\">DefiLlama</a>’s numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXenOdwIIajIY7bxP-U5Oe2jAvhqq6dNLszfvbjNUIgadp9x6CHSxu_2dlV0pPzSZioxukKuownLe4b7GM8KFobhzgyum61mUZJs0MPFxad7uSP4nGil8eEYhtqVT0wwk7-XlMkGMQ?key=iZHG-iO_AQDsFz_3x3YWxSrN\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.artemisanalytics.com/chains?selectedChains=aptos%2Csui\">Artemis</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zooming into onchain activity, Sui’s DEX trading volumes saw a 3x jump since September, overtaking Aptos by a long shot in the last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdqJQVqlSwzCgw26lUiBjulWHrTAzbtTU9Z3rZiWH4xCH65HHT4yRZPpL9tycA9teh8gpP8gt96fPn2FehQUim60H6vtfR9vF9CTmEAv912j6yo2Vw1y7hRS3uT4KuthdzDufkxeQ?key=iZHG-iO_AQDsFz_3x3YWxSrN\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.artemisanalytics.com/chains?selectedChains=aptos%2Csui\">Artemis</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of fees, Sui is also far outpacing Aptos, with $1.1 million generated in October alone, vs. $196k for Aptos.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfLuhT9H7k7HvC4fz6DK0LnfWjbr5DtUcpH3n9xaFYNu1GZavbAqJaor7tQb4RpP_7nFu5dDHCWY3B-VMaC7C4v5zkDdBuFBuW9Ln0QeMHw2My3F3UwOf1ccJM4jRrpstaRZ2J_qA?key=iZHG-iO_AQDsFz_3x3YWxSrN\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Source: <a href=\"https://app.artemisanalytics.com/chains?selectedChains=aptos%2Csui\">Artemis</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the TradFi arena, both chains are pursuing real-world assets. Ondo has deployed its USDY tokenized Treausurys product on both chains, with about $8.3 million on Sui and <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/networks/aptos\">$15.7 million</a> on Aptos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aptos also announced last week BlackRock’s <a href=\"https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/blackrock-buidl-fund-live-on-aptos\">deployment</a> of its tokenized RWA BUIDL fund, while Sui <a href=\"https://blog.sui.io/franklin-templeton-digital-assets-strategic-partnership/\">announced</a> today a partnership with the digital assets arm of Franklin Templeton to support ecosystem growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, both Sui and Aptos are attempting their own hardware plays. Sui is leaning hard into the gaming sector with its handheld console <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sui-playtron-handheld-web3-gaming-device\">SuiPlay0x1</a>, and earlier this month struck up a partnership with the global esports team <a href=\"https://blog.sui.io/team-liquid-myblue-blue-fan-platform/\">Team Liquid</a>, while Aptos has taken the route of a <a href=\"https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-foundation-partners-with-jambo-to-empower-emerging-markets-through-web3\">budget-priced JamboPhone smartphone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> — market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

        "content": "<p><br /><em>This is a segment from yesterday’s Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk to Solana ecosystem people, I’ll sometimes ask what new projects they’ve been hearing about. One such project that’s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren’t useful if they aren’t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation’s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren’t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example — the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t agree,” Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren’t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins “get there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform’s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan’s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem’s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana’s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> — market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

Some crypto is not even a security at all, but we need to make it clear whether or not you would fall within SEC jurisdiction or not.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a token offering falls under the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction, clear guidelines are necessary so crypto firms can decide the right course of action to comply with the regulator&#8217;s rules.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uyeda also defended the creation of &#8220;safe harbors,&#8221; which are regulatory sandboxes where crypto companies could experiment with different products, allowing &#8220;innovation to occur.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SEC Commissioner also argued that regulators must work with Congress and other federal agencies to create a cohesive approach to crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, considering <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/gary-gensler/\">Gary Gensler</a> will step down as the SEC Chair on Jan. 20, Uyeda was asked if he is interested in filling the role, and he answered that this is a decision for the President.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Tokenized funds as collateral</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uyeda&#8217;s call for reform comes amid a wider regulatory shift toward crypto and blockchain technology in finance.

The framework ensures compliance with existing margin requirements set by the CFTC, other U.S. regulators, and derivatives clearing organizations.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the recommendations are not binding, the CFTC frequently incorporates advisory input into its policymaking due to the committees&#8217; specialized expertise. However, there is no specific timeline for when or whether the CFTC will adopt these recommendations into formal guidance or rulemaking.</span></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/trumps-election-win-revives-push-for-comprehensive-crypto-reforms/\">Trump’s election win revives push for comprehensive crypto reforms</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>",
