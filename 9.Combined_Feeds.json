This law has drawn significant backlash from Ardoino, who claims the strict cash reserve requirements could present systemic risks to banks and digital assets.</p>\n<p>Ardoino emphasized the need for a framework that balances risk management with innovation and user protection. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tether&#8217;s decision to delist EURt has not been taken lightly, but until a more risk-averse regulatory framework in Europe is in place—one that fosters innovation, offers the stability and protection our users deserve and avoids potential banking systemic risks—we have chosen to prioritize other initiatives.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Tether might not comply with MiCA, Ardoino pointed out that the firm&#8217;s new initiative, Hadron, will be a top priority in the European region. According to him, Hadron has the potential to revolutionize the accessibility of asset tokenization for institutions, governments, fund managers, and private companies.</p>\n<p>Dutch fintech firm Quantoz has already <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/tether-invests-in-dutch-firm-to-launch-mica-compliant-stablecoins/\">leveraged Hadron to issue EURQ and USDQ stablecoins</a>.

Ondo has deployed its USDY tokenized Treausurys product on both chains, with about $8.3 million on Sui and <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/networks/aptos\">$15.7 million</a> on Aptos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aptos also announced last week BlackRock’s <a href=\"https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/blackrock-buidl-fund-live-on-aptos\">deployment</a> of its tokenized RWA BUIDL fund, while Sui <a href=\"https://blog.sui.io/franklin-templeton-digital-assets-strategic-partnership/\">announced</a> today a partnership with the digital assets arm of Franklin Templeton to support ecosystem growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, both Sui and Aptos are attempting their own hardware plays. Sui is leaning hard into the gaming sector with its handheld console <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/sui-playtron-handheld-web3-gaming-device\">SuiPlay0x1</a>, and earlier this month struck up a partnership with the global esports team <a href=\"https://blog.sui.io/team-liquid-myblue-blue-fan-platform/\">Team Liquid</a>, while Aptos has taken the route of a <a href=\"https://aptosfoundation.org/currents/aptos-foundation-partners-with-jambo-to-empower-emerging-markets-through-web3\">budget-priced JamboPhone smartphone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> — market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>When I talk to Solana ecosystem people, I’ll sometimes ask what new projects they’ve been hearing about. One such project that’s been catching apparent buzz is Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is built on the premise that as stablecoins proliferate, liquidity could fragment, and stablecoins aren’t useful if they aren’t liquid. The platform offers a Solana-based stablecoin liquidity pool, and it plans to offer an <a href=\"https://x.com/SamBroner/status/1857072872205730283\">asset-backed</a> stablecoin in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was founded by Anna Yuan, who started the Solana Foundation’s stablecoin arm during her more than two years at the non-profit. While working at the foundation, Yuan began to see that new stablecoin issuers would mint a lot of tokens but would have limited integrations, and users consequently weren’t able to benefit from stablecoins in the real world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She cited Ondo as an example — the tokenized US Treasury stablecoin has over $100 million in supply but only 3,500 holders, <a href=\"https://solscan.io/token/A1KLoBrKBde8Ty9qtNQUtq3C2ortoC3u7twggz7sEto6\">according</a> to SolScan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I asked Yuan about the commonly cited claim in crypto that stablecoins have pulled off the difficult task of finding product-market fit, or satisfying the needs of an existing market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t agree,” Yuan said, adding that liquidity begets PMF, and most stablecoins simply aren’t liquid enough to be useful. She added that the real-world need for things like money transfers in emerging markets will help stablecoins “get there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perena is currently in closed beta, but the platform’s main feature will initially be a multi-stablecoin liquidity pool which uses a liquidity provider token called USD* that represents a piece of a seed pool containing Tether, Circle, and PayPal USD. In simpler terms, the liquidity pool model should make it easier to issue stablecoins, since smaller coins can access the liquidity from the well-capitalized seed pool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept has raised to-be-announced seed funds, and Yuan’s deep links in Solana helped her tap into the ecosystem’s very-active angel investor community. Yuan said she decided to start raising funds on a Thursday, and by late Friday, she already had a couple dozen angel investors on board. Solana co-founders Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal are both noteworthy backers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of our call, Yuan and I got chatting about how Solana’s stablecoin market capitalization can meaningfully grow. The network currently accounts for just 2% of all stables, according to DeFiLlama.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yuan gave an interesting answer: Solana PayFi could grow the economy for people taking their paycheck in stablecoins. She estimated 2,000 people currently take their full-time salary in Solana stablecoins. That number could certainly get a lot bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> — market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",

To read full editions, </em><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/forwardguidance\"><em>subscribe</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As more investors seem to be seeking exposure to the crypto asset class (particularly after <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-impacts-since-election-outcome\">Trump’s election win</a>), stocks are one way to get involved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s check in on that ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with MicroStrategy, Benchmark’s Mark Palmer on Nov. 18 raised his price target for MSTR shares from $300 to $450. He’s revising that again, according to a Monday note — this time to $650.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes after MicroStrategy last week completed a $3 billion offering of convertible senior notes. It then revealed in a Monday filing that it bought <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/btc-100k-microstrategy-buy\">55,500 BTC</a> from Nov. 18 to Nov. 24 for $5.4 billion in cash (averaging $97,862 each).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSTR shares hovered around $402 at 2 pm ET Monday — down 4.7% on the day but up 70% from a month ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strength of the MSTR rally has some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739669-microstrategy-paying-245000-per-bitcoin-makes-no-sense-mstr-stock\">questioning</a> the idea that these shares should trade at a nearly 3x premium to the market value of the company’s BTC pile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But MicroStrategy, via treasury operations, has generated ~79,130 bitcoins YTD, translating into a 41.8% BTC yield (the % change of the ratio between MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and its fully diluted share count), Palmer explained. That BTC is currently worth roughly $7.5 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We regard the dollar values of the bitcoins that MSTR creates, calculated by using its BTC yield, as analogous to earnings, and we believe they can be projected and contextualized through the attachment of a valuation multiple,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On to Coinbase, Oppenheimer analysts on Monday raised their COIN price target from $265 to $358. The stock was trading around $311 at 2 pm ET Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They mention that the “chilling effect” created by SEC lawsuits against “widely perceived good actors” in the segment, like Coinbase, “can’t be understated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It had deterred new capital going into this space, and many developers had pivoted to other industries,” they added. “But the industry has a chance to rebuild the reputation, and Coinbase is leading this new chapter.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the expectation of a <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/gary-gensler-resigning\">yet-to-be-named</a> new SEC chair embracing crypto as a catalyst, Coinbase’s trading volumes have increased substantially since the US election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Average daily volumes have risen to $6.5 billion since Election Day — higher than the $2.4 billion YTD average prior to Nov. 5. Oppenheimer is projecting Q4 spot trading volume to be $350 billion (would be up 89% quarter over quarter and 127% year over year) and for “high trading volume to sustain under <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/revisiting-trumps-crypto-promises-after-his-election-win\">Trump’s crypto policy</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for other crypto stocks, Compass Point analyst Joe Flynn increased Galaxy’s price target from $22 (CAD) to $33 (~$24 CAD on Monday afternoon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond higher crypto prices and trading volumes momentum, GLXY is set to benefit from its expected uplisting to the Nasdaq and its term sheet with a hyperscaler to host high-performance computing (HPC) at its Helios campus — a datacenter Flynn called an “underappreciated asset.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flynn, also last week, lowered its rating of bitcoin miner Marathon Digital’s stock to neutral. He noted that “while MARA is an outsized beneficiary of higher BTC prices due to its HODL strategy, we don’t see much additional upside from the base business itself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s competing miner Core Scientific (CORZ), which notably <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/core-scientific-rejects-coreweave-buyout-bid-after-big-hpc-deal\">offers HPC hosting</a> to cloud provider CoreWeave. Flynn wrote earlier this month that CORZ is “well positioned to continue expanding their existing lead in delivering application specific HPC/GPU datacenters with a single tenant focus.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CORZ is the top holding in the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) — the largest blockchain-focused equity ETF. Other stocks in the top five are COIN, MSTR, Hut 8 Mining and GLXY.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan Weiskopf, who co-manages BLOK’s portfolio, said it’s hard to value blockchain-fueled disruption over the next decade as regulations become more crypto-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told me: “The real excitement should be around the adoption of tokenization as the application and how blockchain as the technology will <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/investor-appetite-for-tokenized-funds\">soon transform</a> industries across the board.”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/empire\">Subscribe to the Empire newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Explore the growing intersection between crypto, macroeconomics, policy and finance with Ben Strack, Casey Wagner and Felix Jauvin. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/onthemargin\">Subscribe to the Forward Guidance newsletter</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get alpha directly in your inbox with the <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/research\">0xResearch newsletter</a> — market highlights, charts, degen trade ideas, governance updates, and more.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lightspeed newsletter is all things Solana, in your inbox, every day. <a href=\"https://blockworks.co/newsletter/lightspeed\">Subscribe to daily Solana news</a> from Jack Kubinec and Jeff Albus.</strong></p>",
